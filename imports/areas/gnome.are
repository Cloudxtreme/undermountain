A {Mgiant {*snail {xwith a {Wpristine shell {xgoes about eating vegetation.
~
This creature is truly mammoth as far as snails go.  It measures
about four feet from the ground at the top of the shell.  That
shell is an exquisite example of beauty, perfect in its symmetry
and glimmering white with opalescence.  Long eyestalks swivel
about and the creature simply busies itself with finding food.

This goblin is exceptionally large and muscular for its race.
It looks like this is some kind of experimental breed of goblin

all wrong and each limb is a slightly different size, causing
the creature to walk with a limping gait.  Still, it looks quite

This tanarukk is part orc and part fiend.  While it looks
brutish and dangerous with its bristly hair, horns, and

Along a dusty path~
~
A dirt path leads through grassy and slightly hilly terrain.  To the
north, a road can be seen.  Judging from the sounds of travelers heard
in that direction it would appear to be a major thoroughfare.  The dirt
path also leads south where the terrain becomes a bit rougher.

some hillside bushes to the north.

Path beside a gnomish burrow~

A gently meandering pebbly path continues its way through the rolling hills.
Crickets chirp in the grass that carpets the ground and large, shady trees are
easy to find.  In fact, the hillside entrance to a large underground burrow is
partially hidden behind some trees to the south and would be easy to miss.

Curving path through the hills~
~
The song of cicadas drifts along the warm air amidst grassy hillsides and
a pebbly dirt path makes its way through the hills.  It looks infrequently
traveled, judging by the tufts of grass sprouting up intermittently.  The
path can be followed to the north or west.

Intersection in the path~
~
The paths winding through the hills cross, creating a four way intersection
here.  The east-west direction appears to be more frequently traveled, as the
north-south direction could easily succumb to new growth of grass.  Toward the
east the sparse trees start to become more dense and a metal structure of some
kind can be seen.

The beauty and serenity of this path through the lightly wooded hillsides
lends itself perfectly to a lazy stroll.  The easily winding direction might
even seem designed to lull travelers into inattentiveness.  However, if enough
care is taken to look, the entrance to an underground home can be seen between
some hillside bushes to the east.

This one room gnome burrow is quite messy and cluttered.  Mechanical
parts of all kinds, mostly broken, are strewn about on several small
tables, chairs, and even the wooden floor.  A kitchen area off to one
side has a sink full of dirty dishes and an unmade bed can be found
against the opposite wall.

with extra vines and bushes.  However, an observant eye can discern that
it is actually the entrance to an underground home.

easy to find.  In fact, the hillside entrance to a large underground burrow is
partially hidden behind some trees to the north and would be easy to miss.

as if it might be rather frequently traveled as little grass grows in the dirt.
A small, partially root-covered opening in the northern hillside would at first

to an underground dwelling.

say This!  This is an outrage!  This is taken straight from my own work.  Look at these components!
mob echo  {WWindle {xcontinues to study the device, his irritation turning to curiosity.
say Oh, but this... oh my, this is original.  The trans functional conduits have been interlinked with the steam actuators and focused through relational aperture.
mob echo  {WWindle {xsits back in his seat, folding his arms across his chest.
say Well, this concept is truly inspired but the work is crude... inexperienced.  Just look at the size of that thing.  I could do much better work.  But, unfortunately, I don't have the {Mtools{m that could accomplish what I have in mind.{x

say By the Lords, I don't believe it.  You actually found exactly what I need.  With those I can make that contraption much more streamlined.  Matter of fact, I can probably even make that one cannon into two.
say If you give me those tools, I'll be happy to do the work for you in return.

say I don't know exactly what was used to create that crude assembly but with the type of power that thing gives off it was probably destroyed in the process.  I could turn this into something much more efficient but I can't risk my tools to do it.
mob echo  {WWindle {xrubs his chin in thought.
say You know, in the old days, there were tinkering tools that could negate any type of energy feedback.  But nobody's seen a set like that in ages.  Well, they'd be antiques now.
say I tell you what though, if you ever are so fortunate to come across a set of tools like that, you bring them to me and I'll show you just what a master tinkerer can do with that monstrosity.

say Oh my, these are some excellent tools.  Excellent indeed.  However, I don't have need for them at the moment and I would feel bad taking them without giving anything in return.
say Maybe you should hold on to them for a while.  Or, if you are really in need of some coin, Yandi in the equipment shop could probably buy them from you.
