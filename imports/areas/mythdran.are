shield.  Majestic wings spanned across its width, as a flaming tongue of
platinum meandered up one diagonal and a curled tail of silver down the
other.  A sword and a banner adorned the back field, each styled with great
elven craftsmanship.  Below the symbol is etched a faint inscription that
you can still make out, written in elvish:

You trace the images of the silver dragon across the mirrored face of the
shield.  Majestic wings spanned across its width, as a flaming tongue of
platinum meandered up one diagonal and a curled tail of silver down the
other.  A sword and a banner adorned the back field, each styled with great
elven craftsmanship.  Below the symbol is etched a faint inscription that
you can still make out, written in elvish:
{c
"{Wenel erin panta ten quel corm{c"

stranded in that marsh, and yet at the same time I was without the same
fear which gripped me since venturing into the ruins, for I was away from
the demonic beings alone here.  Bring on the death and decay and rotting
corpses and strangling vines.  Bring on the wrenching foulness of this
once beautiful garden defiled into something despicable and profane.  I
will take it all after the hell which I endured to get here.
{x
Much wandering and fighting off of the sentient vegetation that seemed
hell bent on pulling me down into the waters, I came upon a temple.  I
fought my way to the entrance, and found no handle to the stone door
which stood shut and marred with evil runes.  I noticed then a platter
inset at the base and adorned with the silver dragon of Cormyr.  I then
knew that this place had been sealed off from the world by the remaining
members of the Elven Court Mages, as told to me by the lone warrior of
the fringing forest to the south.  He was right in his words that I would
find death within these ruins, so too did I believe him to be right in
asserting that there was indeed a great evil still present--a threatening
evil that I could scarcely hope to comprehend.
{x
Liruthel was a great woman, blessed by the gods to near immortality.  This
much I knew in her look, which enchanted me then as it did in my moment of
rememberance there at the entrance to that temple.  She was of the last of
the Elven Court Mages still afoot in our realms, practicing the lost art
of the elvenkind and offering such blessings to adventurers she deemed
virtuous in her own eyes.  She told me something I had scarcely forgotten
about until then: look to the symbol for the way.  
{x
I knew at that moment what I had to do to open the temple, but my heart
froze upon entertaining that prospect, for I swore as I thought it, the
runes with adorned the doorway began to glow a blood red.  A whisper came
to my mind and beckoned me inward.  Pure fear came to me and I froze in
place for many moments as beads of cold sweat fell from my brow.  I saw
him then, the floating head of a demi-lich, and knew that he was the source
of the Voices which Liruthel and the Warriors of the Elven Court had spoken
of.  The Voices which now beckoned in my own mind to entertain the prospect
of opening that door.
{x
The answer was, simply enough, to look to the symbol:  the symbol of Cormyr
which adorned many things in the glory days of the nation, but scarcely
remained now as demon hands marred it from history.  I remember two objects
brought down from the early expeditions into the ruins. Both shields.  Both
engraved with elven symbols.  To open the way forward, I thus had to find
these shields, or at least one of them, and then I could continue my quest.
{x
To open it compelled me...I cannot resist.

Desolate Lecture Hall of the {3Crying Mandrake{x~
~
This large hall is circular with circling rows of rotted
wooden seats that surround an equally rotted lecture
platform. There are three large shield shaped windows, that
still have remnants of multi-colored stained glass. A
crystal spire makes up the roof of this room. It starts out
as ball and then tapers off into a sharp point ending
almost 300 ft above you. The hall itself is unusally large
for the number of seats that apparently were once here.
Rumors have been told that in its prime, great ArchMages
would teach thier students spells here. When an unusally
flashy spell would be performed by the ArchMage, the light
would be captured by the crystal and a hue of prismatic
colors would form, shoot out and hit other crystals in the
city, creating a gorgeous display of lights. Now all that
is left is a few charts on the walls, depicting different
elements.

Crumbling Outline of an Ancient Hallway~
~
Tall crystal spires form the roof for these halls, they
stretch in a column all the way down the length of the
building. All of them have been damaged in some way. A
few have large holes in them, one is missing its tip and
another has melted and part of it has formed crystal
icicles that hand down from its 400 ft perch. All along
the hallway is an eerie darkness with no sounds anywhere
except that which you make as your heart beats a little
faster.

Once Famous Element Room of the {8Deadly NightShade{x~
~
As you enter this room you see a row of stone tables.
Each table has various metal tubes that are part of it
and stick out from various slots. The floor is litered
with glass, which crunches underfoot as you move threw
the room. A few bottles and beakers still remain with
mysterious liquids that still {^glow brightly{x. Charts
hang from the walls, with ancient elven writing on them,
different symbols, with illustrations of plants. Some are
torn so badly only edges or scraps of the charts remain.
A few are still in good shape, with {!glowing lines{x that
criss-cross on the chart.

Scorched and Mangled Dormitory~
~
A long row of beds, like dead plants in a garden, are
lined up against the walls. Each bed has been either burned
to cinders or twisted in horrific ways. In each bed can be
seen the skeleton of an arm, or leg or other body part.
Many of the stained glass windows have stayed just as they
are, one with the picture of a {3mandrake{x, on with {6witchhazel{x,
another with {8nightshade{x. The last stained glass window is a
picture of a beautiful elven woman, wearing {@green robes{x and

Broken Street of Mystra ~

You walk along the side of a huge scar that runs up and down 
the street. You see that even in the scar, life has taken hold and 
various small mammals and birds scury about in the trees. Brambels 
that have formed below. As you scan for danger and doors that might 
lead to rooms underneath all the debris, you see that the scale of 
destruction is enormous. What was once the most beautiful and largest
of cites in Faerun, with hundreds if not thousands of buildings, has 
been reduced to only foundations and hollowed out city blocks. Huge 
trees are everwhere, mingling with some spires and towers that are
still left. To the north is a huge, impressive building and the 
street continues west and east with various pockets of open debris 
here and there.

Cratered Junction of Mystra and Aerdrie~
~
A gigantic scar starts here and winds its way west on this street.
A canyon ten feet wide and about fifty feet deep has splint the 
length of this street in two. Trees grow out of the scar making it
appear as if small trees have been planted down the middle of this
street. All along the street are piles and piles of debris, some
much larger than others. Flowers have taken hold and grow everywhere
along what is left of the sidewalks. To the east is what remains of
a tower, towards the west the street continues and to the northwest
is a giant building with large {&c{7r{&y{7s{&t{7a{&l{7 spires. A sign,
still {^glowing{x is embedded in a tree, or rather the tree has
grown around the sign and incorporated the sign into itself. It
indicates this is the intersection of Mystra and Aerdrie.

Barely Standing Bottom of a Tower~
~
This looks to have been a guards tower at some point.
There is a rack for swords or spears on the west wall that
has become very brittle. A window to the east is blocked
by a large tree. The only exits are back to the west and a
badly damaged stone staircase that leads upstairs. You do
not know how safe it is to use the stairs considering there
is not much left of the top tower.

Crumbling Staircase~
~
As you climb the stairs, hoping that it does not collapse
and take you with it, you come to the top of this tower. A
few rotting boards are  all that remains of this section.
Only a quarter of the stone wall still remains. From this
view you can see a large crystal spired building to the north
west. You also see a few giant white birds far to your west.
In every large tree you see shadows that move to fast for you
to get a good glimpse of them. You think to yourself that this
might be a good time to leave this area before you make
yourself an easy target at this height.

Lonely Junction of Shaundakul and Aerdrie~
~
This junction remains mostly untouched, only the ravages of time
have taken it's toll on this section of {8Myth Drannor{x.  Ferns and other
plants prosper here, as well, the trees are tall and lush.  The canopy
of the trees provides wide coverage.  Again, the feeling of being
watched prevails and you know you must stay on the move before you
encounter any more creatures.  To the North is what looks likes an
abandoned shop and to the southeast through a grove of trees you can
see a mansion that seems to have survived.  To the west you see the
side of a large structure.  You see a sign on the ground indicating
this was once the intersection of {cSh{gau{xnd{gak{cul{x and Aerdrie.  To the east
is a large wall that stretches about this part of the ruined city. 
Here there is a small breach, allowing access to the eastern ward of
the ruins.

Crumbling Walls of The Old Kitchen~
~
A large pot with weeds growing out of it sits in the middle
of this room. A few rusty utensils can be seen poking out from
the dirt on the foor. Where there was once a fireplace, now only
remains a hole in the wall, with the stones that made it crumbling.
All the walls have huge cracks on them, the foundation looks like
a collection of vast canyons. The only exit is too the west.

Scorched Trophy Room of the House Talanie~
~
This room has collapsed in on itself, only a few feet of
space to move is available. All the rubble has been scorched
{8black{x, with chips scratched out of the stones that made up
the walls. Several large trees have fallen over and have
landed on what remained of the walls, forming a type of
branch roof.

Cracked Trail of Shaundakul~
~
Its hard to keep your balance as the streets are so badly shifted.
Bricks at odd angles jab at the soles of your feet. Some parts are
scorched here and there, others have craters. Melted bricks are also
obvious, although you wonder to yourself what powers were strong
enough to melt whole sections of rock and brick. Everywhere around
you are giant piles of debris, massively tall spires that only
stand because the outline of walls still hold a bond to thier
foundation. There are many tall, ominous trees that have grown in
who knows how many centuries since this city fell. You cannot tell
what lurks in the trees, but you do know that the sounds of
wildlife have stopped and you suddenly feel like your being
watched.South is a large multi-winged structure, east is a small
structure.

Rubbled Junction of Shaundakul and Fenmarel~
~
This area is totally devoid of vegetation of any kind. Only rocks
and lifeless grey dirt remain in this very large area. You can 
faintly make out the smell of sulfer but the coppery smell of 
{1blood{x is VERY strong! A few pot holes are also noticable,
they contain what looks like liquid {8tar{x in them. {&Bones{x of animals
and a few skulls can be seen in piles along the edge of the street,
mixed in with other rubble. In fact you notice that a thin trail
of thick {8black liquid{x connects with each of the puddles. A huge
block of a wall has an old sign in it, one part reads {cSh{gau{xnd{gak{cul{x
and the other part reads Fenmarel. The street continues north,
west and east with a small building to the north west and a tall
spired building to the southeast.

Rubbled Path of Fenmarel~
~
This small street is rather well preserved than what you've
seen of the other parts of the city. Many of the bricks that
once lined the street are gone, but the road is even and devoid
of any major obsticals. The trees here are short, but full of
life, with an occasional brave bird daring to let out its song.
You see movement in the trees but only shadows, fast and quiet.
A gust of wind blows against you, moving you along, almost
pleading with you to make your visit to this city short. North
of here you see a badly damaged building with a large group of
trees growing from within it, and a smaller building closer 
north. To the south you see  a tall spired building and a small
one close by. The street continues north and south.

Moss Lined Resting Area~
~
Only the sides of this building is left, the front is a pile of debris
with large trees growing out of it. Two trees that have grown close together
form a doorway in. All the floor is {@brillant green{x with a magical moss, 
creating an {^eer{8ie g{^low{x against the cracked walls. It smells like cinnamon in 
here and you feel warm and safe from  horrors outside, despite the green glow. 
You also see the remains of old campfires and a small pool of water.

Rippled and Cracked Junction of Hanali and Shaundakul~

A massive crater has been created at the junction of these two
streets. A lonley tree is trying to grow out of the crater, its
chances do not look good. The {&white bricks{x that once made up
this east west street are mingled with the green ones that move
north and south. The streets in any direction are buckled and
uneven with {@moss{x, {2v{@i{2n{@e{2s{7 and {2weeds{x growing from the cracks. To the
north you see a small building that somehow has survived to the
south east, behind piles of rubble and trees, is a very large
structure. To the south is the start of another wider street. A
small sign, bright with magic indicates this junction to be the
streets of Hanali and {cSh{gau{xnd{gak{cul{x.

~
The marble that lines this path must surely have onced started the
walk to the ruined templed to the west. What is left now is broken
bits of marble and stone. You can barely tell that at one point,
an image of a pair of hands grasped together to make a cup, and
out-stretched to offer assistance and aid. Weeds grow up from the
cracks with dried, brittle roots of what used to be a giant, tree
now uprooted and broken. To the east is a path to the broken
bricked streets.

A beginning of a bridge starts here. The make and look of the {#wood{x 
is of {&white oak{x and of impressive quality. For some reason, the wood
has not decayed, which is why much of it has been looted, piece by
piece. Only the rafters and skeleton of the bridge is left, which is of
little comfort if you want to cross the wide and deep chasm that it
stretches over. To the west the bridge continues and farther west you
can see what looks to be a temple of some sort, with part of its walls
collapsed towards the south. To the east you see the makings of a path.

Bricks at odd angles jab at the soles of your feet. Some parts are

obvious, although you wonder to yourself what powers were strong
enough to melt whole sections of rock and brick. Everywhere around
you are giant piles of debris, massively tall spires that only stand
because the outline of walls still hold a bond to thier foundation.
There are many tall, ominous trees that have grown in who knows how
many centuries since this city fell. You cannot tell what lurks in 
the trees, but you do know that the sounds of wildlife have stopped
and you suddenly feel like your being watched. To the east is a very

The wood on this bridge looks fantastic considering the state of

noticed the exact same thing because much of what used to be
floor boards have been ripped out and taken. There is the

be a temple. {2Vines{x twist and tangle along the skeleton of

it might be dangerous to walk on and every step you make, grinds
marble against marble. It reminds you of walking on a frozen {$lake{x

be seen on the ground, as well as pieces of burnt wood. There is a
strong glow of light to the west and a door to the south.

Large {CGl{Wowi{Cng {xAltar{B with the {cS{gy{xmb{go{cl{B of {cSh{gau{xnd{gak{cul{x~
~
A huge altar dedicated to {cSh{gau{xnd{gak{cul{x is the first thing that draws
your eye when you enter this room.  To the north is a statue of an
avatar of Shaundakul, a handsome, tall, man, with long hair and an
impressive two-handed sword he uses almost as a staff as he leans on
it.  He stands on a pair of hands, and although the statue is made of
polished stone, his cloak and hair seem to blow as if facing a strong
breeze.  The soft, warm glow given off by the statue illuminates the
rest of the room, where you can see a few comfortable cots, with good,
warm furs.  As well, the polished pinkish granite floor reflects like
a mirror, hitting the statue it gives off even more light that shines
on well made oak walls.  The walls depict Myth Drannor as it used to
be, A splendid, huge city of crystal spires and Elven towers.  A
sadness hangs in the air as you look at the once grand city and your
not sure, but the statue seems to weep.

Chamber of the Helping Hand~
~
Rows of ancient pews form two columns north to south in 
this room, with a pulpit at the north. Only one row of pews seem 
unaffected by the passage of time, as they are somewhat dusty, but 
otherwise in pristine condition. The rest of them have nearly 
crumbled to pulp, infact all that is left of some of the pews is
dust. Others have been chopped up, splintered and strewn about 
everywhere. Small {2weeds{x grow along cracks in the foundation and
vines have made the scorched walls a comfortable home. The only 
{&illumination{x that gets in is through the open windows.

the west. This looks like it used to be an area where the clergy
could come, sit and converse with one another. Or perhaps a great
dining room where all would come to share the blessings of 
{cSh{gau{xnd{gak{cul{x.

Partialy Collapsed Stone Living Quarters~

This is a rather large room, with several long pallets
strewn about. There are smelly furs for blankets on each one.
In the center is a large table covered with breads, meats and 
some type of brown liquid. The walls are lined with crates, 
barrels, sacks and rusty, well-worn weapons and armor.

Not much of this kitchen is left except a hint of the large 
staff that must have manned it. The once ample food-filled 
pantry is only filled with spider-webs and the cabinets with 
dust. The {8Ma{7r{8b{&le{8d{x Counter tops have been reduced to open areas 
surrounding most of the kitchen. The floor has been split in 
half by shifting earth. There are dented pots and pans 
scattered here and there.

Rocky and Steamy Cavern~

When you get to the ground, you notice that is much hotter
down here than at the top. The area is rocky and difficult 
to step through. Careful there, you almost lost your footing. 
The place almost seems to harbor some type of powerful 
creature. It seems to be a lair. A large well worn trail 
has been made that leads to the south.

Storage Area in a Cavern~
~
This large cavern holds many different objects from wooden
crates to piles of quarry rock. There are stacks and 
stacks of items put in neat piles and narrow trails made
to snake through them.  To the West are {8two large iron
doors{x with a warning glyph on them. A great deal of heat
is coming from the doors and may even burn your hands if touched.
To the north is the entrance to another large cavern. To
the east all you see is darkness coupled with smells of 
meat and carrion. To the south is a large curtain covering 
an opening in the cavern.

Rubbled Path of Fenmarel~
~
This small street is rather well preserved than what you've
seen of the other parts of the city. Many of the bricks that
once lined the street are gone, but the road is even and devoid
of any major obsticals. The trees here are short, but full of
life, with an occasional brave bird daring to let out its song.
You see movement in the trees but only shadows, fast and quiet.
A gust of wind blows against you, moving you along, almost
pleading with you to make your visit to this city short. North
of here you see a badly damaged building with a large group of
trees growing from within it, and a smaller building closer 
north. To the south you see  a tall spired building and a small
one close by. The street continues north and south.

~
A large hill has formed at the center of this intersection.
It is green and lush with grass and a few ferns grow in the
shadows of large trees. Towards the west you see that the road
disapears into a crowd of elephant-ears, ferns, lilies and other 
water plants. You also see what looks like a modest size temple,
the front badly part having collapsed and a few oak trees have
squeezed threw the remains of a domed roof. East of here you see
a small building, perhaps an old house or shop that is surrounded
by a large group of trees. The road continues west, east and
south.

{8Dark and Overgrown Avenue of {2Mielikki{x~
~
At this point the brick road ceases to be visiable because
of a large mass of moss that has covered it and continues
west from here. Huge elephant-ear plants have grown at the
border of the street, mingled with gigantic ferns. The smell
of a swamp assults your nose as a breeze from the west brings
with it the stench of decay with stagnant water. Massive trees
house a few, equally massive white pelicans. They seem unusally
large, with bills that could hold a shark, or perhaps one or 
two people. The trees even look ominous with long, moss covered 
vines streetching between trees. Also to the north is a
building in a sad state of affairs. You see no entrance and 
behind it grows a large group of trees that have grown threw a 
shattered glass, dome roof. You can follow a paved street east 
enter a swampy trail to the west or try to find a entrance to 
the north.

Remains of a Walkway~
~
There are all varieties of flowering plants that look to
have been planted neatly and in pleasing and orderly rows.
A few things are out of place, but it looks like someone or
something has been taking care of this garden in the middle
of a city of destruction. Many of the plants do look
dangerous though, as they are equipped with spiny stalks,
quill like blooms and other sorts of defenses. A few seem to
be following your moves, bringing in to themselves thier
leaves, seed pods, or flowers. There are no birds or other
animals in this area that you see, even the insects have
departed. Its hard to make out any exits because many large
plants block your view.

what looks to be actual {&silver{x in the dragon design. More
than half of the silver is gone and there are holes in the
floor that have been filled with rubble. The walls show
various landscape scenes, one of a mountain lake, another of
a city of tree homes in a {2forest{x. The paint is chiping and has
faded to dull colors. There is no furniture here execpt two
chairs that look to have been put back together after they
had been smashed. There is a large hole in the roof, however
it has been repaired with old {3wood{x. A doorway leads to a dark
hallway to the north, and an arched doorway leads west.

You stumble across a dark and cramped room beneath the shrine, the
entrance well hidden behind a pile of stones, yet not so well that it
goes completely unnoticed.  A few items lie strewn about: some
cookwear, a large blanket, and a pillow.  Also among the belongings is
a modest stone chair with a leather cushion, well worn, and a rickety
bookcase in which is piled many books.  This is most likely the place
where the Sage goes to escape the elements, and find a quiet place to
reflect and read, because after all, he became knowledgeable somehow.

featured faces, shelves built into the wall hold almost 50
small statues. Each statue is intricatly detailed in ivory,
stone or marble. At the base of each statue is a name,

walls, each with portraits of families of elves, some with
an occasional half-elf and one or two with humans in the
family. The tapestries look a bit faded but well taken care
of. There is an exit to the west and south. You see a
fireplace that has a fire in it, to the north.

Gigantic Book and Scroll Filled Library~
~
As you squint your eyes with the glare of the fireplace,
in this other wise dark room, you see walls of shelves.
All the shelves are filled to the brim with a multitude
of books, parchments and scrolls. There are also various 
items that look to be used as bookends, a few strange,
fanged skulls, a dried foot of an ogre, a jar with what
looks like the eyestalk of a beholder and one with herbs
submerged in oils. A few statues stand by the corners,
two robed elves, one male, the other female, looking as
if they are casting a spell. Two statues of an elven
female and male set of warriors line the east wall,
both almost seven feet tall, holding large swords in
thier hands, and shields with a silver dragon on them. 
You almost miss the shadow of a form sitting near the
fireplace, as it sits quietly in a chair in the shadows. 
The only exit is to the south.

You feel the heat of this room as you walk in, with
its bellows still working, and a great heat coming
from the furnace. The walls are lined with old, rusty
armor, all in perfect order as if they were still on
sale to be viewed. A sign near the door says open for
buisness. A ghostly image of a dwarven figure, hammer
in hand pounds at a short sword on the anvil. Eerie
blue sparks are spit out each time the ghostly image
strikes the anvil. He looks briefly up  at you, points
to the armor, the price list on the wall and quietly
goes back to work.

You can tell by the different odd furniture,
salvaged parts that this place has been set up by
some of the creatures that rule this part. An old
door has been placed on blocks to act as a counter,
where customers can be served. Various items are
used as tables and chairs. One table is made out
of a poor unfortunate elf that has been turned to
stone, his back used as the table, a few old
chairs pulled up underneath him. On the walls
behind the counter, hang bodies, some fresh, some
already rancid, of humans and other demi-humans,
as well humanoid and goblin kin. Select chunks
have been cut out of the corpses, and a sign, in
nearly incomprehensiable common describe the
specials of the day.

{7Shattered Entrance to the {&Temple{7 of {2Our {@Lady{3 of {8the{2 F{@o{8r{@e{2s{@t{x~
~
After a brief struggle and moving a few large rocks you
manage to find an entrance into this temple. A painted clay
statue of Mielikki welcomes you as you enter. She is a well
built young woman, dressed in the trappings of a woodswoman,
with a suit of studded leather armor, sturdy buckskin boots,
a long dark green cloak, scimitar straped to one side of her
and a short sword on her left hip. She has long chestnut hair,
in a ponytail, wrapped with black, green and white ribbon.
She has both arms rested on her longbow, her chin resting on
the top of her forearm as she looks out towards the entrance.
Although its only a statue, you almost feel what the Lady of
the Forests could be feeling as she scans the area from her
pedestal. A sense of sadness, with a thin line of hope, an
overpowering desire to give up, an equally overpowering desire
to keep on struggling and a feeling of weariness but a strong
sense of responsibility to stay strong for those that need and 
depend on her. The walls around her are crumbling and whatever
paintings were on the wall are long gone, leaving only
splotches of paint. You see a glade of trees to the north
and a doorway south.

with {3wooden floors{x and {8ma{&rbl{8ed w{&all{8s{x, now it is the home of

protectivley over two elm trees, the oaks growing at slightly
odd angles, as if to make sure the elms get a share of the sun.
The only remnants of the {3wood floor{x are to the sides of this

A few things are out of place, but it looks like someone or
something has been taking care of this garden in the middle
of a city of destruction. Many of the plants do look
dangerous though, as they are equipped with spiny stalks,
quill like blooms and other sorts of defenses. A few seem to
be following your moves, bringing in to themselves thier
leaves, seed pods, or flowers. There are no birds or other
animals in this area that you see, even the insects have
departed. Its hard to make out any exits because many large

{8Pond of{@ Glowing Green Liquid{x ~
~
A small pond of murky water has made it's home here. Water 
gushes from a large pile of rocks, that then trickles down
into the pool. Giant lilies float around the pool, with lush,
thick grass all around. Large moss covered trees provide
plenty of shade from the noon day sun or to hide from Selune
if one so desires. The area is deathly quiet. The sounds of
swamp life that is so deafening in other parts of the area
have vanished. You see an opening in the swamp to the east
and towards the north.

This bridge looks like its only staying up because of
sheer will. Every step you take on it makes small pieces
of it crumble, as you watch parts of it fall into the

end, as to provide protection just in case it just gives
up and lets the stream claim it.

{7Clearing in the {8Drannor {2Forest{x~
~
Strange and mutated trees greet you as you step into this 
portion of the woods. Some of the trees have huge knots in 
them, as if they had once been blasted apart and grown back 
together, making strange, twisted shapes. Others look like 
they have resolved not to be victims again, looking mean and 
alert. Still others have odd shades of hue to thier bark, 
deep {2greens{x, {$blues{x, {3yellows{x, one is even a deep shade of {%purple{x 
metal. A Clearing can be found in the middle, with a multitude 
of wild grain, strangely beautiful flowers, pink and deep 
emerald green grasses. Even a boulder has not escaped whatever 
magic has torn assunder this area, as it is colored a brilliant 
swirling red. The canopy of trees that is common in the other
parts of the forest is absent here, letting in a larger portion 
of the moon and sun.

The {gforest {xis dead silent here, as it grows near the fringes of
the walls of the ancient city.  Between here and the city is a
wide stream that smells of death.  The creatures of the forest
steer clear of it, as if they know there is something wrong. The
walls of the ancient city are tall and very ornate, though much
of it sits covered in a thick layer of {yw{mee{yds {xand {rf{Ml{mo{yw{We{wr{gi{Gn{cg {gvines{x.
It is busted in parts, collapsed in others, yet in those places
where there is nothing, you cannot see through to the inside as
an unknown haze blocks your vision into the ruins.

Drannor Forest ends abruptly here against a long stretch of
{8strange st{yo{8ne{ys{x that rise from the ground as if lifted there
by the gods.  It is deathly quiet here, as there is scarcely
the suffle of creatures about and rustle of wind through the
trees.  To the north and east tower the remains of a ruined
city, the shattered spires a testament to the beauty that was
once there.  A shriek calls out from them and echoes through
the forest as a foreboding warning to stay away.

Gazebo~
~
An iron gazebo is sitting here and has managed to elude
the effects of time. The gazebo looks like it could hold
about 40 people in it comfortably. Entricate patterns of
leaves have been masterfully smithed into each and every bar.
In no place can any seams be seen where the bars meet, almost
as if the whole construction of it was done with one giant,
long, {8ba{7r of ir{8on{x. As it curves, slopes and splits off into
designs of different scenes of nature, you notice that a word
is spelled out along the top skirting where the roof once was.
The word that it spells out in elven is {!Belo'Phfant{x. What
probably was once a beautiful lawn is now mostly mush from the
nearby swamp. The only exit is east.

with each other for equipment and supplies. Vendors have
all types of wares on display for you to inspect. A sense
of eagerness is felt by all, you realise that this may be
a last stop to get any necessities before you head off into
the drannor forest or if your crazy, brave or stupid enough
to venture into the ruined city of Myth Drannor.

Several large rock outcroppings block the far reaches of
the western wilderness here, as Drannor Forest washes up
against it like a calming tidal on the brink of winter.
The stones jut from the earth in random geometries, like
reaching hands to the heavens, marking the beginnings of
the great mountain range that stretches far to the west
and south.  The western edge of the forest follows this
rock formation north to where it thins to a quieting pile
of rubble, and south to where it grows into a towering
wall of dirt and stone.  The darkness of Drannor Forest
looms to the east and the forgotten ruins of an ancient
city can scarcely be seen to the north and east.

This room is filled with a group of frightened, thin slaves 
of various races and sexes. The accommodations seem sparse
and harsh. The only comfort they have from the rubbled floor is 
hay and a few rags that have been tossed in the room. Using 
these materials there have been several makeshift beds poorly
constructed for the more vunerable of this doomed lot on the 
side of the walls of the cavern.

{7On The Edge of the {8Drannor{2 Forest{x~
~
This part of the {2forest{x is deathly quiet, the trees seem
to try extra hard to stay silent. Even so, there is a sadness
that mingles and dances with a partner called fear. A wind
blows against you bringing with it the chill of a warning.
Tall {&c{7r{&y{7s{&t{7a{&l{x spires can be seen above the tree tops, some
missing thier tops, some melted and some with holes blown
in them. You can see mountains of rubble, like a foreboding
wall at eye level through the trees.

Various stalls have been set up along side the road here,
as well as makeshift ones that stretch into the field. A
carnival type atmosphere can be felt here, as people haggle
with each other for equipment and supplies. Vendors have
all types of wares on display for you to inspect. A sense
of eagerness is felt by all, you realise that this may be
a last stop to get any necessities before you head off into
the drannor forest or if your crazy, brave or stupid enough
to venture into the ruined city of Myth Drannor.

A small path has been cleared threw teh forest of trees
that leads to the north. It is a small dirt road, that looks

To the south you hear the voices of civilization and to the

you go deeper into it, with the smell of pine all around you.

log on the fire as the flames overtake it. The strong aroma of 
burning wood mingles with the rabbit that is being roasted on a 
skewer that straddles the blazing fire. There a couple cots 
surrounding the warm campfire. The site looks abnormally inviting 
despite all the danger that seem to lurk in this area.

A wooden bridge has been erected over a beautifully landscaped
courtyard.  It starts at a small ditch near the temple, then it arches
over onto the other side.  You do not see any stairs that lead down
into the courtyard.  A small trail starts here and goes south toward a
thinly grown part of the forest.

A pool with soothing cool waters occupies the center
of the white, rose streaked marbled floor here. The
waters are inside a stepped pit, where one can sit and
relax on the steps. Slightly raised above the pit is a
smooth rose-colored crystal sphere. It glows with a 
pulsating internal light that shed colors of dawn onto
the pool. There are large windows in the conical roof
that catch the rays of the  morning sun to return
energy each day to the sphere. The sphere gives off
rays of warmth as you approach it while standing in
the cool waters.

north and east.

say A Dark Lich, with a dark plan, who commanded psionic magic.

say Another was found by Maritana and her group a long time ago.
say Then I heard a third was found by another adventurer a few years back.
say The adventurer was only seeking to make his fortune in Myth Drannor.
