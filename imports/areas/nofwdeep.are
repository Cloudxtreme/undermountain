A {rstranger{x stands here, being strange.
~
This stranger wears a heavy cloak sewn with thick, fluffy furs. 
Several layers of elkskin adorn various articles along his body,

animal hides.  He looks at those who enter with interest a kind of
interest that both intrigues and makes one weary.

extravagant.  He smiles at all who pass, between casting his strange
spell.  His disposition is not like any wizard's you have met before.

"So it was all a trick!  We were taken in by a millennia old
trick!" {wBosch remarked, half laughing, half in awe. {M "Yes, I can
still hear them laughing" {wI replied, gesturing toward my head. {M"I
upset some delicate balance, and the avalanche came down upon me!"
{w
For a moment, we sat in the bakery and mused about this, not quite
sure what to say, and then I laughed.  Then he laughed, and we had
a good time out of it in the end. I finally intervened for our
sanity:  {M"So back to you again. How the hell did you manage this
faction?"   
{C
"When you did not return, I set the plan in motion, mustering up
the supporters of our faction and petitioning the Tripower for our
cause. And then we waited and hoped you would come back, but set
about the plan as usual.  Interest died down, but it was not
forgotten. This week we have won two great victories:  our faction
and your return.  We have the official word:  Myth Drannor is in
our protection."
{w
I nodded, and found the words to reply, "There are a lot of things
to do now." I remarked.  {M"We have to round up our support and
organize our cause. We cannot do this alone-."
{C
"In due time, Clausius." {whe said, smiling.  {C"Answers will present
themselves, for now we have much catching up to do.  Come, lets

{w
I nodded at the truth he spoke. There was much that I had to catch
up with, and for several hours we did, and others joined us,
friends and acquaintances from long ago...you know who you are for
you were there.
{w
Just before returning to my home, Bosch stopped me outside in
Market Square, {C"One thing bothers me about your side of the story.
If you upset some delicate balance set up within the scroll, and
only bad things manifested, then where is the good of it all?  Did

In the wake of our experiments with the scroll, the Tripower Empire,
under the instrumentality of the organization known as Nytek, was
busy with experiments of their own, many involving the meld of magic
and technology. I had a side interest in their progress, namely in
the field of airship mechanics. On one of my "information gathering"
trips to Torregiano, I met someone who I could only describe as odd.
{w
A tall man, with copper hair and green eyes and a little pet ferret
walked into the bar where I sat that evening. He wore a strange shield
and belt, and carried an even stranger staff. His markings were
familiar, but at the same time, very different for this part of the
world.  I could tell that he wasnt from these parts.  
{w
I remember getting a bit inebriated and having a conversation with
him, namely about airships and travels to the west.  That was where
the conversation seemed to steer itself.  He was very much fascinated
with airship travel, and we talked and drank the night away. He was
one hell of a drinker to keep up with, which is another reason I knew
him to not be from these parts.  Gaolong was with me, drunk as ever,
and kept himself busy with chasing the ferret around trying to eat it.
Ramus was also there, though he didnt care much for conversation.  He
just sat in the corner with his bottle.  
{w
I recall fixing my eyes upon the orb at the end of his staff, which
seemed to beckon me. When I drew near, it glowed with an intense green,
and I amused myself with this for several minutes. The glow made me
giggle.  
{w
I thought nothing of it, and staggered home to bed. Turning out the
lights, I remember an intense green haze had filled my bedchambers
and made it very difficult to get some shuteye. {m"Damn magical lights
messing with me at night!" {wI cursed, only later having the sense to
see that it was that scroll glowing in my half-open bag. 
{c
Somehow, that stranger enchanted the scroll to the point that when I
opened it, it was like opening a familiar book. I saw clearly the
spindles of a spell which could reach into the recesses of the mind,
endowing powerful knowledge to any source the caster chose to direct
it. Needless to say, I didn't sleep the rest of the night.
{w
Instead I sat up thinking about this strange man in Torregiano. Was
he of some higher power, perhaps blessed by the gods, or an immortal
himself? Or was he just a man from a place far more developed than
ours? I sketched the markings from his armor and dug in my archive
for answers. It took perhaps an hour to find a small book with similar
markings. This particular book was given to me by Grandal. He found it
in the High Tower of Sorcery along with an amulet, which I now recall
as bearing that same design. All signs pointed to his lineage as
coming from the Great Wizard's Council.  It was plausible that he
could have unlocked such an ancient spell with ease (enough that he
didn't even realize it). 
{M
"And that is where I left off shortly before returning to my
bedchambers with the scroll" {wI remarked to Bosch, who passively
turned his head from side to side, which meant he was listening
intently. {M"I mustered up some courage, shrugged off the voice of
reason and read from the scroll. It caught afire in my hands, a
bright green one, and sent me reeling across the room with the
force of a hundred ton sledge. I gathered enough strength to crawl
upon my bed, and then there was darkness..."

"Well Bosch, you are apparently the dwarf of the hour, so you tell me
what the hell is going on."  {wI replied, as I tossed the front page in
front of him.  {C"The scroll, you used it I assume," {whe said.  {C"I knew
you couldn't resist forever!" 
{w
Silence. Lots of sparks but no light bulb.
{w
I shook my head.  He laughed.  {C"Ok, ok, I understand you are confused.
Let me explain over dinner.  I am craving some fried chicken if you
will do the honors.  Oh right, another thing to cover..."
{w
And so he filled me in on everything leading up to my sleep. It all
came back to me at once, though I allowed him the pleasure of seeing
the story to its end.  In the interest of time, let me paraphrase his
tale:
{g
Our meeting was through the wizard's guild.  He was a new student
of the arts, with a lore for relics, both past and present.  His
knowledge of ancient facts was only paralleled by his ability to learn
new ones, and so I took him in as a student and gave him access to my
library and archives. It was also then that I told him of my plans to
construct a great archive, a place where all could come to find
information. He was immediately sold on the notion, and the Keepers of
Antiquity was mainly his brainchild. I should clarify and give credit
where it's due, for without Bosch, my idea remained only a scribble on
parchment.  
{g
He learned quickly and efficiently, though he was impulsive and
sometimes impatient.  Within half a year, he had exhausted all of the
resources from my archives and private library, and so it was decided
that an expedition into the Ruined City was in order. Under the veil
of invisibility, we slipped by the demons within and found our way
into an old shop; the original intent seemed to be a shop of magic,
judging from the arcane symbols which adorned the walls.  While
picking fragments of paper from the cracks of the stone floor, Bosch
stumbled upon a loose one, and beneath it was a crumpled scroll, tied
together with strands of leather.  
{g
We took it back with us, along with a few small items, and opened it
up.  Across the top, it bared the name: {8"Scroll of the Waking Mind"{g,
and the rest were bits of sentences and nonsensical phrases, most of
which were really funny when said aloud. In the interest of our
safety and well-being, I will not. 
{g
For weeks it sat upon my mantle, and in that time we probed it for
all of the secrets it contained.  Through stacks and stacks of books
we searched for a translation.  Nothing came from our efforts. 
{C
"And that is where I last left you.  We came looking for weeks
afterwards, but there must have been a spell ward active on you,
for all our efforts at contact failed"{w, Bosch concluded with a
sigh.  {C"We were thinking perhaps you grew tired of us and left for
your old solitude."
{w
That last statement actually sounded appealing to me, though I
refrained from mentioning it.  I continued the story where he
left off.  {M"It stayed with me for quite a long time afterwards,
going where I did in hopes I would find the right person to help me
decipher it." {wI continued.  {M"The right person can come at the
strangest of times."

{M
"Why that rat bastard did it!" {wI muttered to myself as glared at the
paper.  
{c
Here is a good time to explain that the Keepers of Antiquity was an
idea never realized in my prior state. It was an idea I held onto for
perhaps most of my life, with two attempts made at building a great
archive set to preserve the legacy of our world. Both of those attempts,
I would say, have failed, but the latter made for one hell of a
summer home.  
{c
The premise behind the Keepers was a group of good-natured individuals,
who would take up the ambiguous task of cataloging and preserving the
world as we know it and once knew it. The need for preservation came to
me when I was very young, after my exile from the Valley of Titans
while in the company of elves (I shall save this story for later, if
time and the audience permits). It was the stories of the loss of one
of their greatest cities that drew me into my current occupation. It
was much later on that the Ruined City was found, and treasures poured
from its shattered gates into art galleries and private collections
across the realms, with little or no regard for what it once
represented.  It was a place shrouded in intrigue, and the shattered
remains of that great city are forever haunted by the demons who will
not let her spirit rest.  It was a place dear to my heart, which echoed
of the races who lived in harmony within.  It was my obsession.
{w
This takes my story up to that afternoon.  After a few strolls around
the city, I made my way back to the bakery for an early dinner. This
time I opted for the local ale, which was a little better. {cFor really
good ale, I suggest Jack's Bar in Torregiano. Damn good stuff, and you
meet interesting people there, too, which Ill get to in a moment. For
now, the interesting person of the day walked into the bakery at about
the time I sat down with my food.
{w
Barely making eye contact, he approached my table, boosted himself up
onto the chair, and smiled, his beard curling up on the marred tabletop
like a coiled snake.  With a rather raspy voice, he said, {C"Didn't take
long for you to crack it.  I knew if anyone could, it would have been
you."

{w
So for perhaps the next three hours we caught up on things. As you
could imagine, the conversation was a bit one-sided. A few highlights
involved people that I never was fond of leaving the world, presumed
dead, and there were some newcomers who had been coming around that
from the sound of it weren't half bad. The sight of airships was
apparently no big thing now, and it seemed that everyone who's anyone
carried with them relics that had appeared out of the west. When Gao
told this part, he stressed the details, not doubt appealing to my
blatant curiosity. {M"I should have to build a new wing in my archives
for these things" {wI said to him.  Of course he countered with a snide
remark that I have censored here, mainly because I can.
{w
But of all the new things he filled me in on, perhaps the most
intriguing was this business of a new order of government. I vaguely
remember the declaration some time before my unfortunate accident.
Speculations made rounds that internal corruption had weakened the
Tripower Empire, and that factions were a last ditch effort to keep
order.  Another popular one was that these so called 'factions' were
only puppets to a dictator who would take the stage in the next scene.
I had to discount the latter, for reasons that will become evident
shortly.  As long as there will be glory hounds, there will be
speculation.
{w
We wound up our conversation with a few lighthearted remarks and the
Gao stood up and said {G"I have a match to prepare for, so I must get
going.  I am going to try out some new equipment, so wish me luck!"
{wAs he walked out the door, he stabbed a piece of paper with his sword
and lifted it towards me.  {G"Page 3 has something interesting that I
didnt get around to mentioning.  Have a look!"
{w
Pulling the page from his sword, he bid me good day and I resumed my
seat in the corner.  The front page was plastered with the following
headline: {W"The People Have Spoken:  Pax Faerunis to Rule Westbridge
Territory." {wFrom there was dwarfed the actual article which read from
an account of the polls.  There was a boxed list of members to the
left, and I could recall many of the names, despite my disjointed
memory.  They were a nice bunch really, and I would have time later
on to congratulate them once this business of getting settled back
into my life was over.  On the next page was a smaller heading that
read, {W"Other Factions To Rule Various Parts of the Realms" {wand second
from the top of a short list was a name which struck me like a brick:
{w
The Keepers of Antiquity...

I was Clausius Sagacus, son of Valine, born in the Valley of Titans,
raised by elves, and admitted into the guild of sorcery the 17th year
of my worldfall. This resulted in the solitary life that I knew well,
and ultimately to my odd infatuation with the past. 
{c
Yes, yes, facts about myself, but I wouldn't be throwing them out
there if they did not bear some relevance to my tale.  My father
actually had a different name in mind for me, but my mother wouldn't

choked down the brew, I dove into the black soup that is my mind
for some more answers. There was a faint presence, almost alien,
in there. {m"Hello, there intruder. What are you doing inside there?"
{wNo answer.  I could hear it vaguely, laughing. It was gone again.
I sought it for answers, but nothing.  
{w
Then came a sound I could not mistake for my life...
{w
I was across the table in the time it took for the blade to be drawn.
It was Sunderfury.  Looking behind me, I soon saw the familiar face
of Gaolong laughing at me as he pointed his sword toward my food.
Before I could blink, he lifted it up in the air and caught it as it
slid down the length of his blade.  Gaolongs infernal laughing
drowned out the delicate ring of the blade.
{M
"You bastard" {wI protested, but I could not expect anything less from
him.  If ever you have a chance to meet him, you will find him to be
a rather showy character.  Just watch your dinner.
{G
Where you been?" {wGao asked between bites, {G"We thought you were dead.
{M
"I was a bit detained in my dreams," {wI said, not knowing what else to
say. {M"I just woke up from one hell of a sleep and found my way here.
What day is it anyway?"
{w
Gaolong thought a moment, tapping his sword against the ground as he
sat.  {G"13th of Uktar, if Im not mistaken.  Yah, thats the day!  I
got my match coming up."  {wHe pointed to the flyer with the words {W"Gao
Schlong" {wwritten beneath his name. A once crude depiction of him was
now adorned with a moustache and a pair of rose-tinted shades.  I
cracked an uncontrollable smile.
{w
Uktar...Crunching the numbers in my head, I came up with approximately
9 months of slumber, and only if it was still the same year.  It was
a miracle that I was still alive, but the whole situation had the
hints of powerful magics at play.  Though I was curious about how
long it really had been, I decided it was best that I didnt know
just yet.  When you get my age, a couple of years of sleep could do
you good. Hell, waking up every morning is a blessing, so why push it.
{w
I looked over Gaolong with admiration.  He had acquired a few more
interesting pieces of equipment that glimmered with his own personal
touches.  Most were mangled so badly with his own personal touches,
that no one else would want to touch it.  A few more scars, but other
than that, he hadnt changed a bit.  I forwarded the question {M"So
whats new in the realms?" {wto which I received a long reply...
{w

{W
"Clank" {wcame the sound of the door behind me. Out of reflex, I raised
my hands with some jarbled jargon at the tip of my tongue. Though I
felt foolish when I realized my haste, my actions sparked one of those
rare moments of serendipity.  I was, of course, a wizard, who found
little more use out of his sword than the Dragon Queen would find out
of a wedding dress.
{w
I commanded a vocabulary of arcane knowledge, and to this point had
been very modest in employing it.
{w
First off was this little business about starving to death. I called
upon some food, and to my dismay, a colorful fungus sprung up at my
feet. It looked more like a drug-induced piece of artwork than edible,
nothing like the rations I used to know.  I kicked it slightly with my
boot and it went flying off into the darkness, undoubtedly safe from
anyone else who might stumble upon it.  
{M
"This will not do," {wI thought.  Something began to well up inside me.
Perhaps it was a powerful spell that would bring an end to space and
time.   Nope, it was my damned stomach, who would have been very
happy eating things that appear at one's feet, but I was more of the
finicky kind. My mind mulled over the notion of hungry and out came
a name.  I found the right words and hand gestures, and in an instant,
I was there.  I could get used to this...
{M
"Westbridge" {wI said to myself.  Now this was a familiar memory. 
{c
I always thought the name was deceiving for new adventurers, for when
they set out on a quest, they always headed east, since Westbridge was,
of course, west. If you really want to pull a sneaky on them, say that
you'll meet them in Thalos.
{w
I made my way from Temple Square to Market Square, then Festival
Square, which seemed to have been claimed by the mafia in a recent
event.  I must have slept through that one. I passed a pub on the way,
and found my way back to it. I ordered a bottle of 'local specialty'
but let's just say specialty is an over fancied word for piss. Across
the way was a cafe that looked inviting, but that was neither here nor
elsewhere in my desires.
{w
Making my way back toward the fountain, I veered left into a rundown
pit of a joint, better known to most as Tom's Bakery. There, I
purchased two massive pot pies and found my favorite table at the far
corner. It was marred with the carving of people's names I did not
recognize. Only faintly did I see my own, and that of a friend, which
remained freshly cut into the soft oak.  Tacked along the walls were
flyers advertising the arena, as well as several obscene comments hand
written below the contestants names.   A few made me laugh.
{w
And so I sat and ate my pies and nursed my ale and pondered things.
Memories trickled in like late runners in a marathon. Some were good,
many were bad, a few were just plain strange. I dwelled on each memory
just as I savored each bite of my breakfast. Of the last recollection
to jog in was my name...

Do you know what the sound of a thousand year old booby trap being
sprung sounds like?
{c
I do, though I wouldn't know where to begin as far as explaining it.
Mix a night of heavy drinking in Torregiano with an hour inside Curtis'
Shack, and then throw yourself off the top floor of Fanatics. Maybe 
you'd get an idea how I feel right now.
{c
No?

Perhaps if I start from the beginning, I could win your empathy.

{c
Let me see, I suppose I should start with three days ago, since my
story began then.  Well it actually began about 170 years ago, but
never mind the details...
{w
I remember the colors drifting in and out of my field of view.  The
loud rush of silence rang in my ears. Patterns of darkness swirled
and gathered into focus. My head swam with confusion.  It was the
ceiling of my bedchambers, set in what would one day become my grand
archive. {c(For those who don't know, I sleep there also).
{M
"How, where?" {wI whispered, startled by the strangeness of my own
voice.{M "It is real?!"
{w
But I cannot deny my own senses. It was if I had awakened, or been
pulled, from some other reality into a world that remained until this
day an afterthought. My mind grasped for the retreating fibers of a
dream set in the depths of reality, but came up empty handed.
{w
I rose to my feet as beads of chilling sweat ran down my face. A pile
of ashes lay scattered across my bed. They disintegrated to the touch.
I looked over to the perpetus counter on the bed stand.  It had
stopped quarter phase mid-month. My muscles ached immensely, almost to
the point of atrophy.  As I started to move, I became aware that my
equipment had become tangled in the bed sheets.  Why I chose to sleep
fully geared was beyond me.  I reasoned it as yet another mystery to
solve.
{w
I stumbled over to the chest of drawers, the hardware black with
tarnish, and leaned upon the timber for support. Looking into the
mirror, which hung nearby, a faint image of myself came into view
amidst the scattered moonbeams.  It was an apparition that I met eye-
to-eye--long beard, bony face, and wrinkled complexion.  Apparently, I
had overextended the benefits of beauty sleep.
{w
I rubbed the shaggy beard and backed away from the image.  Some things
were familiar, like my clothes and the furniture, but others were not, 
ike who the hell I was.
{w
I walked through the hallway, passing piles of masonry and unmixed
mortar to the foyer.  Directly ahead was the library, the door still
slightly ajar, and to the right was the doorway outside, which I
approached.  The deadbolt would not budge, and so, unsheathing my
sword, I proceeded to beat it into submission with the hilt.  It
finally gave, and the door opened with a loud creak. I stepped outside
into the foreboding depths of Drannor Forest, but don't ask me where I
thought I was going.

The Long Road continues to the north and south, cutting slighty to
the west as it leads northward, and opening into a fairly large
settlement directly south.  A few farms are scattered about as the
scenery opens up to vast stretches of flatlands and patches of
foothills.

To the west, nothing.  To the east, nothing.  The only real

On this monotonous and long stretch of the Long Road, there is
little to see that has yet to be seen.  Far to the east are some
foothills, and to the west as far as the eye can see are vast
stretches of nothing.  The open sky heralds an air of freedom, but
this is short lived as there is no protection from thieves and bandits
this far north.

The road is well packed and hard from centuries of traffic, though
never in those years was it ever set with cobblestones.  Only the
roads near the City of Spendors is so fortunate to be done up in

comfort.

On this open stretch of nothing, there is a sense of lonliness, but
immense freedom from the bustle of civilization.  The occasional
carrion bird will swoop overhead in search of some food, or perhaps in
hope that you will become food.  Maybe if one gets close enough, there
will be some sport in killing it.

Here, the Long Road begins to make its way to the northwest,
curving into some foothills far to the north.  Directly west is
nothing but flatlands and grassy plains and to the east is the same,
though there is some hill country within eyesight.  The tiring journey
along this road is further grounded in the monotonous scenery that
accompanies it.

The Long Road makes its way northwest towards the Xantharis Keep
and much further north, the city of Mirabar.  For many traders, this
is their final stop, as southern goods fetch high prices there, and
likewise for their goods being sought after in the south.

This long stretch of the long road is where perhaps it gets its
name.  Those who undertake this stretch often devote a full day or two
depending on if they're on foot or not.  While there is little brush
for robbers to hide along the side, they are still out and about, and
the further from Waterdeep one travels, the more likely they are to be
found.

Perhaps it is stretches like this that give the Long Road its name.
The walks are long and quiet, and there is little to see than a far

The stream slows its descent down to the marsh as an ominous haze
blankets this area.  The path ends abruptly here as the stream
continues through some brush.  It is clear that few dare tread any
closer to the marsh, for doing so would challenge death to a duel.

a desolate patch of marsh that the unfortunate residence of
Rassalantar live near.  Rumors of monsters and the undead circulate
about this bog, so unless you have an wild hair for adventure, turning

from here and takes the inland route east of the mountains.  The tall
peaks of the Sword Mountains can be seen not far to the North.

The Long Road leads to the northeast, where it intersects
settlements such as Amphail, Red Larch, Longsaddle, Westbridge, and
the illustrious Mirabar far to the north at the spine of the world. 
Riches can be gleamed to those few who can make that journey and back.

the Long Road cuts though the plains on its long and dusty way into
the northern wilderness.  Looming above you to the north you see the
tall peeks of the Sword Mountains.  South of you lies the last

Rassalantar is a caravan watering stop along the road.  It is
nothing but a spring-fed pond surrounded by half a dozen walled farms
and an inn.  The pond drains into a stream to the east that empties
into The Stump Bog, a sprawling desolate marsh, haunted by monsters. 
The ever-present fog and the nearby bog makes the hamlet a unpleasant
campsite.  The inn 'The Golden Dragon' lies to the east and to the
west is a small strip of trees known as the Keep Woods, located
between two farms.  The Long Road continues to the north and south.

inspection, the stones seem to be buried only a few breadths deep, and
several are suspended upon their short end, such that their weight
along would normally make them unstable.  Each is painted with many
runes, that glow faintly in the shadows, suggesting they are enchanted
with magic, which may also explain their precarious balance among the
ring.  The circle of stones is warm, calm, and almost inviting for a
passive observer.

This small building houses an independent game hunting group
which flourishes from the pelt trade along the Long Road. It
is here that traders first stop with their trophies in order
to barter a higher price, though this lodge has a reputation
for being picky and their method of payment is rather sketch.{x

This room is set up for the members and guests to take some
time out and relax while waiting for the next expedition to
hunt a trophy. There's a ratty old couch sitting next to an
old stone fireplace, with a few people standing around here.{x

This room is a nice quiet spot far removed from the rest of
the commotion.  A few lamps hang from the lumber walls here
and there is a small vent that links the fireplace to here,
giving this place warmth regardless of how cold it gets out
and about. Not only is this lodge a comfortable place to be,
it offers up protection from would be thieves and predators.{x

There is a large, stone wall between you and a small room
where a husky human sits reading a book. Two sets of bars
keep you and him apart, perhaps for when a trade goes bad.
A sign hangs just beneath the window, listing the current
trade prices they pay for a select number of trophy items.{x

stakes around several horse drawn carts.  There is a rather tall man
standing outside of the big one holding a gnarled cane that he waves
to passing travelers in hope of drawing a few near.  It would seem
that it worked, at least in your case.  {x

from his thick leather armor and holding chains that he has wrapped

to be noticing you.  Perhaps he will let you have a look.  {x

The ground is broken in near all places and the tent poles are knocked

trampled by past visitors such that the ground is hard and littered
with trash.  A kid stands in front of both tents diligently doing the
job he was hired to do.  Above the northern tent is a sign bearing the
name "Suglios' House of Chance" with two white cubes and a stack of
platinum tickets.  To the west is a large tent built against several
of the larger carts, which you recognize as being used for
transporting prisoners and live game.  {x

say We slayed it, or rather dismembered it such that it could do no harm.
