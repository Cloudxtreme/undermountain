This witch was given a job as the librarian of the Church many
years ago, and has since gained quite the reputation for being less
than tactful about her charity case.  Many wonder why she is still
here, though they wonder more why the Church has given her the
responsibility of delegating the passing rites of new members.

He is pretty damned old. He's so old, he doesn't have much hair anymore,
just a few patches of white strands that look like cob webs. He was once
a member of Mystra's clergy, and probably served in one of her chapels
for many years until age caught up with his youthful vigor. The church
still keeps him around, and here is wanders in the forests of the Isle
of Mystra's Dance, lulling away the times when the church was at her
glory. He still predicts for those who will listen that Mystra's Church
shall oneday return to glory.

He looks very young, though elves always do. He has a fair complexion,
almost feminine, and carries long, thin hair down across his back. He
wears forest clothing, woven hairs and fibers with leaf coverings. He
carries a basket full of goodies, all things of the forest, though no
meats, for his race is largely vegetarian.

chapter4~
{B I speak of the Seven Sisters, born under Mystra's hand, to be the sort of
{B mortals she needed, and that I need even more these days. Mortals are
{B wondrous, complex things; my own power is not yet risen enough that I dare
{B attempt to make or bear Chosen as she did . . . wherefore I look endlessly
{B about Toril, seeking fitting mortals who have arisen on their own. 
{B I watch over all who work with the Weave, or meddle in its workings. I
{B watch most those who fascinate me with their daring, their accomplishments,
{B their characters . . . or their love. I watch these seven often, almost as
{B much as the old rogue who kept my predecessor's power in the time of her
{B passing, and gave it so willingly to me. She lives on in him, and in me. 
{B She lives on more splendidly still in those who could be termed her
{B daughters: the seven mortal women who share a sex, silver hair, beauty, and
{B wits. They have outlived most mortals, and still enter each day with gusto,
{B a constant delight to me. My only disappointment is that they do not work
{B together more often. 
{B Yet once in a passing while-in particular, when I nudge them ever so gently
{B from behind all the curtains of concealment I can spin-they do . . . and I
{B love to watch them at work. 
{B 
{B Watch them with me now. 
{B 
{B Aye, my eyes shine. When I was a mortal, I wish I'd lived as these
{B magnificent ladies of mine do. 
{B I am Mystra, and to you all I give this gift . . . the Seven Shining of my
{B Chosen. Aye, I weep; whatever you may think, mortal, it is a gift given
{B with love. {x

chapter3~
{B The power I oversee, because of its might, is a danger to mortals, to gods,
{B and to Toril. All three may be blighted or ruined if the Weave is torn or
{B misused enough. I stand against that. I am the Guardian of the Weave, and
{B its lover. Those who serve me must be the very best of mortals, so that
{B they blunder little, and love the Weave as much as I do, coming to
{B understand it as best they can-and far better than others. 
{B Chosen do my work best when they feel my hand but lightly; when they feel
{B free to move and act as mortals do, finding their own vision of the Weave,
{B and serving me in their own ways. 
{B Chosen are not easy to find. Chosen are so special that I have managed to
{B keep no more than a bare two handfuls of those my predecessor raised to
{B their station. The greatest work of my predecessor-the Mystra who was not
{B once a mortal who took the name "Midnight"-was the birthing of Chosen she
{B could not find, and so had to make. 
{x
{g ({8continued CHAPTER4{g){x
~
E
chapter2~
{B This vast, ever-changing, living Weave is a tapestry of power beyond the
{B minds of mortals, though with each passing year my work gives me back
{B bright payment, and those who work magic can do a little more, and see a
{B little more. 
{B Yet those who can see and work with much more than most are rarely sane.
{B The power burns them, twists them, and makes all that is flawed and mean
{B greater. Wherefore we have cruel tyrants, liches walking beyond death who
{B desire to destroy or use all that lives, and wild-eyed dreamers who think
{B that to reshape all Toril to their own visions is to master it. We have
{B lands of mages who destroy or ruin more than they ever raise up; we have
{B doom and devastation, and lives wasted or shattered. Mortals know the pain
{B of such darkness, but I share it. I have the work of banishing the gloom
{B and seeking to temper the blades that are mortal souls so that each time
{B they can take a little more, do a little more, see a little more. 
{B In this work, my hands are manyfold, thanks to the few mortals who can see
{B and work with more Art, and remain sane-or, as some of them have put it,
{B "sane enough." 
{B I deem these rare few, if they will serve me, my Chosen. And they are rare.
{B Mortals are so easily bent to willfulness by power, so easily broken into
{B tools I can no longer use, for I work with love, and must be served
{B willingly, by those who love me. I shall not compel service, ever. I will
{B not become what my predecessor did, in the despair of her long waiting. I
{B shall give with love, and never cease in my giving.

Words cannot describe Our Lady, for she transcends mortal
thought. To describe her with mortal features limits the
scope of what she encompasses, yet this is how we can
begin to understand.
{c
Mystra is our goddess of possibilities.  Without her, magic
as we know would not be possible.  As such a power offers
great potential to go great things, it must be shared and
taught to all who show wisdom in wielding it.  It is never
to be hidden, or destroyed, or used towards evil intents.
The destruction of the Art is a condemnable sin that we do
not take lightly for it was given to us in good faith and
trust.  
{c
Mystra is the embodiment of the Weave--the source for all
magic which binds our universe together and bridges the
gap between that which we cannot touch, raw magic, to that
which we can wield, disciplined spellcasting.
{c
We have all seen Mystra, whether it be the blue glow on
items imbued with magic, or the cool breeze that carries
sparkles of inspiration.  She is always with us, always
watching and always there when we cast a spell.  In our
history, there have been several accounts of the physical
incarnation of Our Lady, but all have fallen short of
describing her entirely.  All agree than it is impossible
to do.  For those who have seen her describe a perfect
complexion, white and radiant that moves with echoes much
like in another plane of existence. She is often described
with dark, flowing hair haloed with nine stars, sometimes
blue, other times red.  At her bare feet rise mist, also
taking on either or both colors, that serves to conceal
much of her physical form. None have yet to describe her
voice, which they say after an encounter fades from memory.{x

ceremonies~
{x
{WDaily Communion {8- {BThe daily prayers.  This is a personal ceremony
that is unique for each member.  The faithful of Mystra choose one
hour or more each day at a particular time to constantly pray for
spells. In this way they can encourage personal development and 
make communion with the Lady.
{x
{WAscension {8- {BThe day Mystra ascended to godhood.  Celebrated annually
the 15th of Marpenoth, this day is marked by continual praise and
attention to Mystra and the Art.  Clergy of Mystra celebrate this day
in different ways, depending on local traditions and personal choice.
{x
{WStarflight {8- {BThe initiation or celebration ceremony.  The ceremony is
presented in many forms, and centers around exemplifying the Gift of
magic, through flight.  Specifically, a flight spell is casted such
that it remains strong for as long as the stars in the sky remain
visible, hence the name.  The rest of the ceremony is adapted from
local traditions and culture, but common to all is devout worship and
praise to Mystra and to the Gift which gives meaning to the 
ceremony.  Some common events to celebrate with this ceremony include
the union of two of Mystra's faithful, the initiation of a new member
of the church, or a milestone in the life of a current member, that
can be the creation of a new spell or a vision of the Radiant One.
{x
{WMagefire {8- {BThe renewal or rededication.  Many times requested out of
need to come closer to the values of the church, Magefire represents
the rededication of Mystra's faithful to her beliefs and teachings.
The ceremony is marked with a unified calling of the magefire that
courses through the body as a blazing blue flame, spilling over as it
cleanses and renews.  This ceremony can be especially taxing to those
who are new to it.
{x
{WHymn to the Lady {8- {BThe solemn call of rememberance.  Performed mainly
at funerals, this ceremony brings forth the clergy in song as images
of mages past and faithful of Mystra course through their minds.{x

the walls are the lines of age old waterfalls now dry and

relatively level despite the seemingly chaotic means that
this passage was formed.  Overall, there are other forces
