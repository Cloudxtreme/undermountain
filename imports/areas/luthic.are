{gSo you want to make a shop?  On a mud?  It's unheard of!  Not really,
{gbut you've come to the right place to figure out how to do it, so 
{glet's get started.  If you're looking to make a pet shop or mount
{gshop, you'll need to reference {W[{BRead Pets{W][{BRead Mounts{W]{g.
{x
{gFirst of all, it is not necessary to flag your room as a shop.  This
{gallows you to create street vendors and the like.  If the room on 
{gyour map is meant to be a permanent shop, then you should flag the
{groom: shop.  If your mob is a shopkeep, make sure you flag it with
{gact sentinel or else it will wander around.  Be certain it is immune
{gto summon and charm.
{x
{gSecond, you must put a shop on your mob.  This step is crucial as,
{gif you want the mob to sell anything, it has to be a shop to do so.
{gIn medit, on the mob you wish to be a shop, type: {Yshop assign{g then
{ghit enter.

{gAt the bottom of your mob list, you will see that the mob is now a
{gshop, along with some other fields.  You'll see:
{x
{Yshop hours - {y0-23 for a 24 hour system, MUD time, not real life.
{Yshop profit - {y(markup[buying]/markdown[selling]) This lets you set 
{y              whether the shop keeper is a crook, buying things for 
{y              low prices and selling them for high, or a saint, buying 
{y              things at high prices and selling them low, or just your 
{y              every day shop.  Default levels are 100% for both and 
{y              without good reason, should stay that way.
{x
{gThe hidden variable is what the shopkeeper buys back, as just
{gsetting it as a shop will only sell items, even though you may 
{ghave set the profit margins.  To let a shopkeeper buy items from
{gplayers, you will need to assign it types of items it will buy.
{gYou can set 5 types total - from armor, weapons, treasure, to
{gjewelry, gems, and furniture.  You set this by typing:
{x
{Yshop type <0-4> <item type>
{x
{gPawn shops typically have multiple types, while a jewelry shop
{gmay only buy jewelry or gems.
{x
{gThird, you will need to give the mob items!  You do this by setting
{gresets.  To learn more about resets, {W[{BRead Resets1{W]{g.  Have the vnums
{gof the objects you are selling handy.  First, reset your mob into
{gthe room:
{x
{Yreset 1 mob <mvnum> 1 1
{x
{gThen, start resetting items {WIN THE INVENTORY {gof your mob, by typing:
{x
{Yreset 2 obj <ovnum> none
{x
{gAnd do this for each.  Once everything is in place, {Ypurge {gthe room
{gand type {Yredit reset{g.  Watch the magic unfold!

Magic items pertain to objects that are potions/scrolls/wands/staves/pills.
It is important here, just as everywhere else, to use good judgment and not
make an item that makes all else obsolete.  Below are some basic guidelines
to help you make your items.  When in doubt, please ask!
{x
{Y1. Object level should equal the level required to cast the spell.
{y     For example, a heal pill must be at least level 22 because that is
{y     the level a cleric must be to cast it.
{x
{Y2. The maximum level of the spell should not exceed the level of the
{Y   object by more than 10 -OR- 40%, whichever is greater.
{y     For example, a level 50 pill can have a level 60 spell (10 levels)
{y     or, at most, a level 70 spell (40% more than level 50).
{x
{Y3. The value of the item should be no less than twice the cost to create
{Y   it using empower if putting the item in a shop.
{y     For example, if you are making a magic item shop, the cost for a
{y     heal potion should be no less than 50 platinum, sanctuary no less
{y     than 150.  Again, stat items to be sure you are not making something
{y     that renders all else obsolete.
{x
{Y4. Charges on wands/staves should be proportionate to the power of the spell.
{y     For example, a level 40 wand could have more charges of a level 35
{y     spell than a level 40 spell.
{x
{MHandy Chart!
{y     As always, here is a chart to help you.
{x

{x
Remember, we truly want to keep a balance out there, so use discretion
when making items that heal or do damage.  Healing potions shouldn't 
be just a usual occurrence in every town you come to.
{x
{RAddendum: {YPlease do NOT make any items with class specific spells or
{Yskills, such as, meteor swarm, creep, divine wrath, etc.  Any item
{Yusing a class specific spell/skill will be denied and require a 
{Ychange.  Thank you!{x

this book there have been warnings against using spells and skills, warnings

if you use them, it could result in your area remaining closed.  Yet you are

So you're finally ready to get underway.  Congratulations.  Here's 
hoping you have a lot of fun and create something great.  We have
no time to waste, so let's get started!
{x
First thing you will need to do is create that first room.  You
should have already been assigned an area, so to see your vnum block
type: alist builder <your name>.  You should see something like this:
{W[231] Forgotten City c.2012              (56900-56999) fcity.are{x
The numbers in the parenthesis are your vnums.
{x
{YType in: {Rredit create <your first vnum>
{x
That's all there is to it!  That is your first room.  Now {Ytype {Rgoto
{R<your first vnum>{x.  Here is where the real fun begins.
{x
{YNote:{y If you have an area with rooms already, see {W[{BRead Redit4{W]{y.
{yYou will be "deleting" exits and "linking" them, rather than
{y"digging" rooms.  If you or your area is brand new, continue.{x

{B=======
{Y1. Show
{Y   syntax: show  (or hit return)
{c-------
{y   This command will show you the room statistics that you've been
{y   working on.  It will reveal the Name, Area, Vnum, Sector, Room
{y   flags, Health recovery, Mana recovery, Clan, Owner, Characters
{y   currently in the room, Objects, and exits.  
{Y>>>>>Subcommand alert!  {wIf you type "commands" while in redit, it 
{w     will bring up a listing of commands you may use in the editor.
{w     Not all of them are useful, below you will find the ones that
{w     are the most important.
{x
{B=======
{Y2. Name
{Y   Syntax: name <name of room>
{Y   Example: name Dungeon of Dispair
{c-------
{y   Easy enough.  Rule of thumb, names should be short, and should
{y   be capitalized like a book title.  Color can be added, but should
{y   be used sparingly.  The default name color for Waterdeep is bright 
{y   blue.
{x
{B=======
{Y3. Desc
{Y   Syntax: desc
{c-------
{y   This will bring up the description editor.  In general, if you put
{y   a {{ in the first line, everything else will line up.  Otherwise,
{y   the mud defaults an indentation in the line.  Remember the rule of
{y   thumb - if it's a basic room, 4-6 lines is sufficient.  {YTyping in
{R   .h {ywill bring up the tools for using the editor.

First of all, congratulations.  You are now building for one of
the longest continually running muds out there and one that has
one of the best player bases in terms of loyalty and fortitude.
{x
With your help, Waterdeep can continue to expand and grow, but
first you need to know a few things regarding the book you now
hold in your immortal claws.
{x
{R1) This book is NOT to be used outside of Waterdeep for any
{Rpurpose other than reference.
{x
{R2) This book is NOT to be copied or given to ANY other MUD or
{Rposted on ANY website without permission from Nisstyre.  The 
{Rbig man himself.
{x
{R3) Information in this book is NOT to be given to players on
{Rthe main port without permission from your head builder and/or
{Rany level 109 immortal.  This is a building guide and should
{Rbe reserved for builders ONLY.
{x
We want you to enjoy yourself and have fun building because that
it will be your reward to see the players on the main port having
fun in the confines of your brain child.  Ensure that you can 
keep building from now and into the future by taking your job
seriously!  There is no pay for this line of work, but there are
many hard working builders making Waterdeep the fun place that
it is.  Keep yourself counted among them!
{x
Last of all, we are all here to help one another.  If you have
a question, ask your fellow builders.  The only dumb question is
the one not asked.

{YYour Current Head Builder is: {WLuthic
{yIf you have any questions or concerns that are not answered
{yby this book or your fellow builders, or a question or concern
{ythat needs to be addressed privately, please note your head
{yhead builder and they will respond as soon as possible.

First and foremost, to the players Mielikki and Sandra, who put

DizzyMUD, and the work done by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn for the

and Satin to bring us up to Rom 2.4x.
{x
My personal thanks go out to Mageslair.net in addition to the 
above for having the best newbie builder guide out there, and 
countless websites for having information still available in
this age of MMORPG's.  It's great to have a place that still
relies on the wonders of reading and simple imagination to make
everything possible.

These are the rules of the builder port.  Not knowing them isn't an 
excuse, especially when you have this book.  Always check back in on
this page to know if an update has been made!
{x
{G1) Only build in the zones {Ryou are assigned to {Gunless given permission
{Gby a 110 or your headbuilder. If your name isn't on it, don't edit it!
{x
{G2) Equipment should follow the guidelines put forth in the WDOLC with 
{Gthe anticipation that any equipment too powerful or potentially imbal-
{Gancing will require changes before your area is cleared to go live.
{x
{G3) Objects  should follow the guidelines  put forth in the WDOLC with
{Gthe anticipation that any object made too powerful or imbalanced {RWILL 
{Grequire  changes before your area is  cleared to go live.  If special
{Gcircumstances  apply, you will  need to speak  to your headbuilder to 
{Gclear them.
{x
{G4) Builders {Ware permitted {Gto stat items/mobs with the following excep-
{Gtions:
{x
{W* You may {RNOT {Wstat runs/run mobs/run mprogs/run gear/IQ items without
{W  permission from your headbuilder.
{W* You may {RNOT  {Wstat objects unless they  are {Rrelevant {Wto what you are
{W  creating. That means {RNO {Wstatting mobs/objs just to satisfy curiosity.
{x
{G5) Builders are permitted to go into areas with a security level of 10
{RONLY {Gto help with your own area.  Builders {Ware also permitted {Gto visit
{Gother  areas actively  being built  {Ywith the  consent  {Gof the  builder 
{Gcurrently working on that area.  ALL OTHER AREAS, {RINCLUDING {Grun areas/
{GIQ  areas/IMM areas are absolutely  off limits without permission from 
{Gyour headbuilder.  That means you may {RNOT {Gwander the builder port.  If 
{Gyou are in violation of this rule, you will be subject to punishment.
{x
{G6) Anything being  done on this port is considered confidential and it 
{Gis a  major violation  to discuss  any developments on  this port with 
{Gplayers of the main port.
{x
{G7) Builders must include all areas to which they are currently assigned 
{Gin their description. Builders without an area may note your headbuilder

{YWe do not  pressure our builders with timelines or quotas to fill each 
{Yweek, but we do ask if  a builder is going to stop building or be away 
{Yfor an  extended period  of time, that  notification is  given to your 
{Yheadbuilder, this  would be any time of 2 or  more weeks that you will 
{Ybe away.  Failure  to do so may  result in  your builder being removed 
{Yfrom active duty and your area reassigned to someone else, or demolish-
{Yed.  {RThis is for ANY builder on this port.
{x
Last  of all, every builder  on this port is logged.  That does mean all 
that you say and do is visible to your headbuilder and other higher ups.  
Logs are checked to ensure that the rules are followed and the port runs 
smoothly.  Any infraction  on this port can  be carried to the main port 
on your mortal/immortal there.  Play it safe!

These are not rules, but mere observations that will help you on
your building journey.  Everyone has their own style of doing 
this job, and if you don't yet, you'll find ways that work best
for you.  In the meantime, here are a few suggestions that may
make your work easier.

{x
{GGraph Paper
{g  Ohhhh, just the name brings back memories of D&D, doesn't it?
{g  Many a builder uses the tried and true graph paper to lay out
{g  a design before actually building it.  (I can't tell you how 
{g  helpful it is to be able to see my vnums inside those beautiful
{g  little boxes - like my own private map to my area.  It also 
{g  allows you to see what you have before you go through the time
{g  and trouble of building it.  Countless times, I find I OVER
{g  estimate the size of an area given the vnums, and through my
{g  trusty graph paper, I can fix errors before I have to FIX
{g  errors.)

{x
{GBuilding a Skeleton.
{g  This is laying out the rooms without bothering to name them,
{g  flag them, describe them, or anything.  Just getting the
{g  foundation in place.
{x  
{x
{GFleshing it Out.
{g  This is a matter of personal tastes.  Some people make their
{g  mobs and objects first, others name the rooms and make their
{g  descriptions first.  Either one is fine, and is completely 
{g  up to you.  (I prefer naming my rooms, describing them, then
{g  filling them in so I have a completed shop/home/etc, but this
{g  is also depending on how I feel for the day.)
{x
  Remember:  Descriptions are important.  You don't have to
  write them out before hand unless you like working that way,
  but they should be lively and vivid and NOT roleplay for the
  player.  More on that in the guidelines section.

will allow you to do everything a builder will need to do.  If you 
have questions, remember, ask.  If you're not sure of a command, ask.
{x
{CPrompt
{c -This is the first thing you should change since you no longer need
{c  to be concerned about your hit points/mana and so on. As a builder, 
{c  you have other information you need to be concerned with. Though 
{c  you can later alter it to your wishes and desires, for beginners, 
{c  this is a good start.  Type in:
{x
prompt Area: %z | RVnum: %o | Editing Vnum: %R | Current Editor: %O
{x
{c  You will see now that the Area reads what area you are currently in,
{c  RVnum shows the room vnum you are currently in.  The other two will
{c  fill in when you're in the editors, which we will discuss in just a
{c  few pages.  Feel free to color your prompt as desired.
{x
{CHolylight
{c -Never be in the dark again.  Holylight will make it so you can see 
{c  no matter what.  All the cool immortals use it.  You want to be cool, 
{c  don't you?  Type holylight to toggle it on and off.
{x
{Cgset <vnum>
{c -This will let you have a room that you "goto" when you type in "go." 
{x
{Cgoto <vnum> (or go alone to use your gset location)
{c -Fancy way for you to "go" to whatever room you want.  You simply 
{c  need to know the vnum.  If you want to go to your gset location, 
{c  just type go.

{c  -You may notice when you use alist that there is a small box

{CTime
{c  -It is useful to have a basic understanding of how ticks operate.
{c   First of all, ticks are randomized to a certain extent - so they
{c   are not always the same length.  This prevents predictability.
{c   What follows is a very general guideline for time passing:
{c          1 hour of game time = 5 ticks
{c          Each tick is roughly 1 minute of real time.
{c          Therefore: 1 hour of real time = approx. 60 ticks or 12 
{c                     game hours.
{x
{CMoney
{c  -The economy in Waterdeep is based on silver, gold, and platinum.
{c   When building mobs, you will only be using amounts in silver, so
{c   what follows is the conversion rate:
{c          100 silver = 1 gold
{c          100 gold   = 1 platinum
{c          Therefore: 10000 silver = 1 platinum, 1000000 = 100 platinum
{c   Please be careful when giving mobs money - we do not want to 
{c   flood the market and make platinum worthless (inflation).

{RPutting Stats/Affects on Equipment
{8-------------------------------------------------
{rSo special it gets its very own page.  Part of the fun in building
{ris making new gear for players to wear, but that is also part of
{rthe vast responsibility you wield.  {RTo put it bluntly - if you
{Runderpower an item, no one will use it, if you overpower an item,
{Ryou make other gear worthless.  
{x
{rThe following guidelines are for {WLEVELING {requipment only, that
{rmeans anything under level 101.  If you are making hero gear, or
{rare working on run equipment, you will want to stat other gear
{rto ensure that what you are creating does not negate everything
{relse out there.
{x
{rThere are always exceptions and here are a few.  {RYou should {WNOT 
{Rmake statted lip equipment, anklets, back items, tattoos, religious 
{Rsymbols, earrings, surrounding, instruments, ID, or rings without
{Rapproval from your head builder.  {rThese items are delicate and
{rtoo much on them could result in seriously imbalancing equipment
{rthat is already out there.  It is not to say that you CANNOT, but
{rthat without approval beforehand, or a good reason, you may have
to change your items come inspection time.
{x
{rA general rule of thumb is this:  {YBack = rare/hard  {YLip = Ultra rare
{Y/Ultra hard {R(no joints){Y, ID = no stats but needs purchase/really
{Ygood reasoning. {R(ID should be more for IMMs to use.){x

{rAll other slots mentioned above need to have balance as their
top priority.  Ask or stat other items of similar level to
help you make determinations on what you should do.

{rIt is worth stating that not everything needs stats/affects, nor
{rshould everything have it anyway.  You are working on a spider
{rweb where everything you do affects every other strand - use
{rcaution and wisdom and be judicial when statting equipment.

{rFinally, AC is currently NOT used on Waterdeep.  As such, there 
{ris little need to worry about using it and it will not have a
{rtable.

{x
{rPutting stats on your weapons is not necessary, and should

Welcome to the guidelines section.  These are a few guidelines
that will help us keep our mud on target with its theme, as 
well as ensure that the player who explores the areas has a
world that is rich and enjoyable.  These are not "rules" but
stand as very good standards and ideals to build by.  Enjoy!
{x
{MThe Dreaded "You"
{m  -One of the worst things visible on any mud is to have
{m   "you" in the descriptions.  Part of the issue with this
{m   is that it makes presumptions about the character and
{m   roleplays FOR them.  You might have a character who is
{m   evil, yet to say in the description, "You feel an aura
{m   of evil that shakes you to your core," would be a very    
{m   untrue statement indeed. 
{x
{MMobs in the Description
{m  -Yet another issue is when a mob is described in the room.
{m   The trouble with this comes about when a player clears
{m   out the room.  If you have described, "Hundreds of riders
{m   crest the hill, ready to slay anyone in their way," well...
{m   no they're not.  Keep mob descriptions on the mob, not in
{m   the rooms.
{x
{MWidth and Length
{m  -While it is tempting to write entire paragraphs to describe
{m   a room, the truth is, general rooms should be from 4-6 
{m   lines, saving longer descriptions for more important places.
{m   Width is also a consideration, a basic rule of thumb is as
{m   wide as the finger command - 70 characters at most.  This
{m   will prevent players from having to widen their screen just
{m   to see the room.
{x
{MFinal Fantasy 6, 7, and Forgotten Realms
{m  -Waterdeep is a themed mud, using mobs, items (with one
{m   notable exception), and places from Final Fantasy 6 and
{m   7, as well as Forgotten Realms.  Guns are the only items
{m   that need special permissions to be made.  Steampunk is
{m   also an element of the mud, and as such, you can create
{m   areas that reflect that aspect within the confines of the
{m   theme.  If you would like more information, find a fellow
{m   builder who can help you, or ask your head builder.
{x
{MColor!
{m  -Be judicious in your use of color and use it sparingly.
{m   If every room is an explosion of color, then special rooms
{m   you may create become less special.  This is not to say
{m   you can't use it at all, but if you truly want that evil
{m   dungeon sacrificial altar room to stand out, go easy on
{m   the colors until you get to that place and make it rock.
{x
{MSpellcheck
{m  -Use it!  If you are using Cmud as a client, it has a built
{m   in spellcheck.  If not, you can always copy and paste into
{m   a word document.  This will keep your area from looking
{m   amateur or just poorly done.  Let your hard work stand up
{m   to any test!  Proofread and spellcheck!

So you've laid out your rooms and got yourself a super awesome
area all ready for the next steps.  Congrats!  Now comes the
section of the guide that tells you how to make stuff for your
area.  The good times are about to get better.
{x
Before we begin there are a couple things to note.  Back/Lip
and ID items require special consideration.  As well as anklets
tattoos, religious symbols, earrings, surrounding, and instrument.
{YIf you are planning on making these - {W[{BRead Helping2{W] {Ybefore
{Yyou start.  These have guidelines that must be followed to get
approval!{x
{x
First we should note that your vnums for objects are the same
as your vnums for rooms, which will be the same vnums for mobs.
What this means is that within a given range (say 43000-43099)
you have 100 vnums for rooms numbered 43000-43099, 100 vnums
for objects numbered 43000-43099, and 100 vnums for mobs numb-
ered 43000-43099.  So when you create your objects, you don't
have to worry about your rooms matching up or vice versa.
{x
{YType in: {Roedit create <your first vnum>
{x
This opens the editor and creates your first object.  How
exciting!  This is how you create any and every object in
your area.  Let's find out what you can do. 
{x
{M=======
{C1. Show
{C   Syntax: s (or just hit enter)
{m-------
{c   This will bring up your editor and show you the stats you 
{c   have on your object.  The fields here are a little different
{c   from redit, so keep reading to find out what they do.
{x
{M=======
{C2. Commands
{C   Syntax: commands
{m-------
{c   Just like before, typing in commands will show you a list of
{c   commands you can use within oedit.  Some will be useful, 
{c   some will not, and some may not even be implemented yet.  We
{c   will cover the most used ones here.
{x
{M=======
{C3. Name
{C   Syntax: name <insert name>
{C   Example: name golden fleece
{m-------
{c   This sets the name of the object which is DIFFERENT from what
{c   the player sees.  This should contain keywords for the player,
{c   so if you make a "baton of rat bashing" name would contain:
{c   baton rat bashing.

{M=======
{C4. Short
{C   Syntax: short <insert string>
{C   Example: a baton of rat bashing
{M-------
{c   This is what the player sees with the item in their inventory.
{c   Do NOT capitalize the a/an!  Otherwise, when a player wears
{c   your item, it will say, "You wear A baton of rat bashing..."
{c   This short string should go into a sentence.  Only capitalize
{c   proper nouns/titles - just like any good english sentence.
{x
{M=======
{C5. Long
{C   Syntax: long <insert string>
{C   Example: A baton of rat bashing lays here, forgotten.
{m-------
{c   This is what shows up if the player is NOT holding the item
{c   and it is on the floor or just in the room.
{x
{M======
{C6. ED
{C   Syntax: e add <keyword>
{C           e edit <keyword>
{C           e delete <keyword>
{C           e format <keyword>
{m------
{c   This is the same as the extra descriptions in the room, but
{c   it is on your object.  This is nice if you want your player
{c   to see more than just the long description when they use
{c   'look item.'
{x
{M=======
{C7. Type
{C   Syntax: type <type>
{C   Example: type weapon
{m-------
{c   Type is what kind of object you are making.  To see a full

So here we are, ready to create and populate your area with
the denizens that call it home.  But how do you make them?
Well, join me on the journey and find out!
{x
To create your first mob, you will need to type:
{x
{Rmedit create <your first vnum>
{x
And like magic, you are in the editor, staring at a brand
new life waiting to be born.  As with any editor, typing s
or just hitting return will show you all the stats for the
mob.  And just like the other pages of this book, I'm going
to walk you through exactly what they mean.  Ready?  Let's go!

{Y1. Name
{Y   Syntax: Name <insert name>
{Y   Example: giant gold dragon
{r-------
{y   This is NOT the name players see when walking into the room

{y   what is in the short.

{Y2. Act
{Y   Syntax: act <flags>
{Y   Example: act sentinel stay_area aggressive
{r-------
{y   These are the bread and butter for your mob and give it the

{R              NOTE: {wnobd_drop will also make a mob see through
{w              imp invis.  Unless you are making a clan hall guard
{w              or an imp-invis mob, you should {RNOT {wuse this flag.
{w              Your head builder will be on the lookout for overuse and
{w              without a compelling reason, you will be made to change

{y   Raising this number increases the frequency with which a mob

{Y8. Damage Types
{Y   Syntax: damty <type>

{y    Please be judicious in using offensive behaviors, not every mob should be

{Y19. Size
{Y    Syntax: size <size>
{Y    Example: size small
{r-------
{y    Size matters!!!  The size you select does have bearing on your mob.  See the
{y    chart below for more information:
{W         Size            Affects               Examples

{Y    Syntax: material <type>
{Y    Example: material flesh
{r-------
{y    Currently, material isn't implemented for any use, but still can be filled
{y    in.  Try to keep to a single word.
{x
{R=======
{Y21. Start/Default position
{Y    Syntax: position <start/default> <position>
{Y    Example: position start sitting
{r-------
{y    The start position is the position the mob will be loaded in, default 
{y    is what it will do once it is done fighting.  Sleeping default will not
{y    happen.  Positions are: standing, sitting, resting, sleeping.
{x
{R=======
{Y22. Silver
{Y    Syntax: silver <number>
{Y    Example: silver 1000
{r-------
{y    See {W[{BRead Helping1{W] {yfor a money conversion table.  Mobs should not be
{y    laden with money without very good reason.  A rule of thumb is {RNO MORE
{y    than 100 silver a level.  This means at level 100, your mob will drop
{y    10000 silver (1 platinum).  Keep in mind, animals (rabbits, foxes, etc)
{y    really shouldn't drop money.  Leave it for the sentient mobs.
{x
{R=======
{Y23. Special Functions (Spec)
{Y    Syntax: spec <spec flag>
{Y    Example: spec spec_breath_frost
{r-------
{y    These are ways to make your mob a little tougher than normal, but you
{y    should also use spec flags VERY sparingly, especially the lower the
{y    level of your mob.  In general, level 80+ mobs would be a better fit
{y    for a spec than a low level when using damage specs.  ? spec will 
{y    bring up a list in editor, to see what they do {W[{BRead Mobflags3{W]{y.
{x
{R=======
{Y24. Short
{Y    Syntax: short <string>
{Y    Example: short a disembodied head
{r-------
{y    This is what is seen when the mob does something or in combat.  Like
{y    other short strings, it should only be capitalized if it is a proper
{y    noun, and do {RNOT {ycapitalize the first letter unless it is a name.
{x
{R=======
{Y25. Long
{Y    Syntax: long <string>
{Y    Example: long A disembodied head floats here, waiting to strike!
{r-------
{y    This should be what the player will see if they enter the room with
{y    the mob.  It should stick to one sentence in length.
{x
{R=======
{Y26. Description
{Y    Syntax: desc
{r-------
{y    This is what the player will see if they look at the mob.  3-6 lines
{y    should be enough here, and should be descriptive.  You may use color
{y    here if you wish.

Here on Waterdeep it takes a level of 106 to be able to create and
implement mprogs on your mobs.  As such, there is so much on the 
topic it requires another book! 
{x
If you are not level 106, you will need to not only show you are a
dedicated builder to get to 106, but will need to begin reading up
on what makes mprogs tick.  You can load our mprog guide to begin
studying.  {WLoad obj <vnum unknown>
{x
In the meantime, being too low to create your own mprogs does NOT mean
that you cannot have them.  You will simply need a level 106 to help 
you create them and put them on your mobs.  If you have an idea for
something, ask for the help.  With time and patience, you may find 
yourself creating your very own mprogs for Waterdeep.
{x
If you are already 106 - load the book and get crackin!

{x
And here we get to the bread and butter, the one thing that
stands between your building a bunch of stuff, and your having
an area that is populated with that bunch of stuff - resets.
{x
Resets are what you put in place to tell the mud that you
really DO want your stuff to show up.  You tell it how many
of what, in what order, and whether it is on a mob or inside
a container.  Resets make the mud go.
{x
During a reset, the area executes all the commands at once.
It is reset when the server loads (reboots), as well as
periodically as it "ages," which is roughly 3 minutes if
no one is in the area, or 15 if they are.  (Minute = 60-90
seconds.  See {W[{BRead Helping1{W]{w for time.)
{x
Basically there are 6 things do with reset commands:
* load a mob/mobs into a room
* load an object into the room
* put an object in an object
* give/equip a mob with an object
* door resets (currently not available)
* randomized exits
{x
There is also an order that the resets should follow:
{R1) object in the room
{y2) container object in the room 
{Y3) object/objects stored within the container within the room 
{G4) mobs within the room
{B5) object/objects on the mob in the room
{M6) container object the mob has 
{m7) object/objects stored within a container that the mob has 
{x
Each reset will be given a number, visible when you type "resets"
in the room.  They load in order from one on up.
{x
So, how do you do it?  Well let's get started.

{WRegarding Damage{x
{x
Here is where I make a humble suggestion.  If you aren't ready to have
your mind blown, you probably shouldn't be on this page.  The formula
for figuring damage isn't necessarily difficult, but it is a journey
into the bowels of code, then an exercise in patience, and a dash of
frustration.  But hey, what would life be without that one little monkey
wrench to make it interesting?
{x
The formula per the code goes like this:
{cdam = diceroll(x,y)

{cif ( enhanced_damage ) dam += 2 * (dam * chance / 300)

{cdexmod = <-125 to 125>
{cac_app = (+AC + dexmod) / 10
{cac_app += ac_app / 2
{x
{cdamroll_app = damroll * skill / 100
{x
{cdam += Minimum(0, damroll_app - ac_app)
{x
{cif ( dam > 35 ) dam = ( dam - 35 ) /2 + 35
{cif ( dam > 80 ) dam = ( dam - 80 ) /2 + 80
{x
{cif ( sanc )   dam = dam / 2
{cif ( invoke ) dam = dam / 2
{x
{cif ( protection ) dam = dam - (dam / 4)
{x
{cif ( immune )    dam = 0
{cif ( resistant ) dam = dam - (dam / 3)
{cif ( vulnerable) dam = dam + (dam / 2)
{x
{cResult dam > Actual damage dealt
{x
{wThe hell what? you say?  Indeed.  Allow me to break this down
{wfor you and hopefully erase confusion.  There are only a few
things that you, as a builder, need to be aware of within this
tiny snippet of code.
{x
In loose terms, the bonus rolls in damage (the + number after the dice),
are immediately affected by the AC and Dex a character fighting your 
mob has.  So, lets say your player has an AC of -300 and a dex of 25.
You would first divide AC by ten and make it absolute.  300/10 = 30.
Then add your dexterity.  30+25 = 55.
{x
You take your bonus, (Say your mob had 12d40+300), and subtract the 
number from the player's AC+Dex:  300-55=245.  Now we will add this
in with the damage using the average:  12d40=147 + 245 = 392.  That is
the damage your mob did this round with the bonus, minus the AC/Dex factor.
{x
Now for the fun.  Since your damage is over 35, the mud halves it:
392/2=196.

Since it is over 80, the mud halves it again:
196/2=98
{x
If your player has sanc on, the mud halves the damage again:
98/2=49

If they have holy invoke, another half:
49/2=24.5
{x
If they are resistant or vulnerable, the damage is divided further,
by 3 or 2, respectively.
{x
After all that, the damage finally lands.  So why do you care?  Because
this will affect how your bonuses are calculated, as they are NOT straight
forward!  It is not a simple <dice>d<dice>+bonus.
{x
If you are confused, fear not - simply use the default stats chart in
this book {W[{BRead Defaultstats1{W]{w, which will help you create mobs
that are currently being used to level.  This page WILL help those who
are creating Run level mobs in determining their damage.

{x
{gSo you want to make a shop?  On a mud?  It's unheard of!  Not really,
{gbut you've come to the right place to figure out how to do it, so 
{glet's get started.  If you're looking to make a pet shop or mount
{gshop, you'll need to reference {W[{BRead Pets{W][{BRead Mounts{W]{g.
{x
{gFirst of all, it is not necessary to flag your room as a shop.  This
{gallows you to create street vendors and the like.  If the room on 
{gyour map is meant to be a permanent shop, then you should flag the
{groom: shop.  If your mob is a shopkeep, make sure you flag it with
{gact sentinel or else it will wander around.  Be certain it is immune
{gto summon and charm.
{x
{gSecond, you must put a shop on your mob.  This step is crucial as,
{gif you want the mob to sell anything, it has to be a shop to do so.
{gIn medit, on the mob you wish to be a shop, type: {Yshop assign{g then
{ghit enter.

{gAt the bottom of your mob list, you will see that the mob is now a
{gshop, along with some other fields.  You'll see:
{x
{Yshop hours - {y0-23 for a 24 hour system, MUD time, not real life.
{Yshop profit - {y(markup[buying]/markdown[selling]) This lets you set 
{y              whether the shop keeper is a crook, buying things for 
{y              low prices and selling them for high, or a saint, buying 
{y              things at high prices and selling them low, or just your 
{y              every day shop.  Default levels are 100% for both and 
{y              without good reason, should stay that way.
{x
{gThe hidden variable is what the shopkeeper buys back, as just
{gsetting it as a shop will only sell items, even though you may 
{ghave set the profit margins.  To let a shopkeeper buy items from
{gplayers, you will need to assign it types of items it will buy.
{gYou can set 5 types total - from armor, weapons, treasure, to
{gjewelry, gems, and furniture.  You set this by typing:
{x
{Yshop type <0-4> <item type>
{x
{gPawn shops typically have multiple types, while a jewelry shop
{gmay only buy jewelry or gems.
{x
{gThird, you will need to give the mob items!  You do this by setting
{gresets.  To learn more about resets, {W[{BRead Resets1{W]{g.  Have the vnums
{gof the objects you are selling handy.  First, reset your mob into
{gthe room:
{x
{Yreset 1 mob <mvnum> 1 1
{x
{gThen, start resetting items {WIN THE INVENTORY {gof your mob, by typing:
{x
{Yreset 2 obj <ovnum> none
{x
{gAnd do this for each.  Once everything is in place, {Ypurge {gthe room
{gand type {Yredit reset{g.  Watch the magic unfold!

{gSo you want to make a pet shop or a mount shop, well this is the
{gright page to determine how to do that so you don't have headaches
{gdown the road.
{x
{gThe first thing you need to know is that pet shops and mount shops
{gneed {WTWO {grooms, in order.  That means rvnum 100 and rvnum 101.  The
{grooms {WMUST BE IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER{g.  Otherwise you can hang up your
{gdreams of making a pet/mount shop!
{x
{gThe first room will be your shop.  This is where the player will
{ggo to buy their new friend.  The second room is where the pets/
{gmounts will reset and live until they're purchased.  This room can
{gbe visible to the player (such as a stable), or disconnected from
{gthe area and only open to immortals (flag the room gods_only, nogate).
{x
{gYou will need to add the flag, {Ypet_shop {gto the shop {WONLY{g, not the 
{gloading room.  For a mount shop, add the flag {Ymountx_shop{g.  You
{gwill then need to set a shop on your shopkeeper {W[{BRead Shops{W]{g.  You
{gdo {WNOT {gneed to set anything for the shopkeeper, the room flag will
{gmake the mob do its job.
{gIn the pet/mount reset room, you will need to add resets for

{gThe first room will be your shop.  This is where the player will

{gmounts will reset and live until they're purchased.  This room can
{gbe visible to the player (such as a stable), or disconnected from

{x
{gYou will need to add the flag, {Ypet_shop {gto the shop {WONLY{g, not the

Magic items pertain to objects that are potions/scrolls/wands/staves/pills.
It is important here, just as everywhere else, to use good judgment and not
make an item that makes all else obsolete.  Below are some basic guidelines
to help you make your items.  When in doubt, please ask!
{x
{Y1. Object level should equal the level required to cast the spell.
{y     For example, a heal pill must be at least level 22 because that is
{y     the level a cleric must be to cast it.
{x
{Y2. The maximum level of the spell should not exceed the level of the
{Y   object by more than 10 -OR- 40%, whichever is greater.
{y     For example, a level 50 pill can have a level 60 spell (10 levels)
{y     or, at most, a level 70 spell (40% more than level 50).
{x
{Y3. The value of the item should be no less than twice the cost to create
{Y   it using empower if putting the item in a shop.
{y     For example, if you are making a magic item shop, the cost for a
{y     heal potion should be no less than 50 platinum, sanctuary no less
{y     than 150.  Again, stat items to be sure you are not making something
{y     that renders all else obsolete.
{x
{Y4. Charges on wands/staves should be proportionate to the power of the spell.
{y     For example, a level 40 wand could have more charges of a level 35
{y     spell than a level 40 spell.
{x
{MHandy Chart!
{y     As always, here is a chart to help you.
{x
{WSpell                    Max Charges              Minimum item level

{x
Remember, we truly want to keep a balance out there, so use discretion
when making items that heal or do damage.  Healing potions shouldn't 
be just a usual occurrence in every town you come to.
{x
{RAddendum: {YPlease do NOT make any items with class specific spells or
{Yskills, such as, meteor swarm, creep, divine wrath, etc.  Any item
{Yusing a class specific spell/skill will be denied and require a 
{Ychange.  Thank you!{x

So you're finally ready to get underway.  Congratulations.  Here's 
hoping you have a lot of fun and create something great.  We have
no time to waste, so let's get started!
{x
First thing you will need to do is create that first room.  You
should have already been assigned an area, so to see your vnum block
type: alist builder <your name>.  You should see something like this:
{W[231] Forgotten City c.2012              (56900-56999) fcity.are{x
The numbers in the parenthesis are your vnums.
{x
{YType in: {Rredit create <your first vnum>
{x
That's all there is to it!  That is your first room.  Now {Ytype {Rgoto
{R<your first vnum>{x.  Here is where the real fun begins.
{x
{YNote:{y If you have an area with rooms already, see {W[{BRead Redit4{W]{y.
{yYou will be "deleting" exits and "linking" them, rather than
{y"digging" rooms.  If you or your area is brand new, continue.{x

{B=======
{Y1. Show
{Y   syntax: show  (or hit return)
{c-------
{y   This command will show you the room statistics that you've been
{y   working on.  It will reveal the Name, Area, Vnum, Sector, Room
{y   flags, Health recovery, Mana recovery, Clan, Owner, Characters
{y   currently in the room, Objects, and exits.  
{Y>>>>>Subcommand alert!  {wIf you type "commands" while in redit, it 
{w     will bring up a listing of commands you may use in the editor.
{w     Not all of them are useful, below you will find the ones that
{w     are the most important.
{x
{B=======
{Y2. Name
{Y   Syntax: name <name of room>
{Y   Example: name Dungeon of Dispair
{c-------
{y   Easy enough.  Rule of thumb, names should be short, and should
{y   be capitalized like a book title.  Color can be added, but should
{y   be used sparingly.  The default name color for Waterdeep is bright 
{y   blue.
{x
{B=======
{Y3. Desc
{Y   Syntax: desc
{c-------
{y   This will bring up the description editor.  In general, if you put
{y   a {{ in the first line, everything else will line up.  Otherwise,
{y   the mud defaults an indentation in the line.  Remember the rule of
{y   thumb - if it's a basic room, 4-6 lines is sufficient.  {YTyping in
{R   .h {ywill bring up the tools for using the editor.

First of all, congratulations.  You are now building for one of
the longest continually running muds out there and one that has
one of the best player bases in terms of loyalty and fortitude.
{x
With your help, Waterdeep can continue to expand and grow, but
first you need to know a few things regarding the book you now
hold in your immortal claws.
{x
{R1) This book is NOT to be used outside of Waterdeep for any
{Rpurpose other than reference.
{x
{R2) This book is NOT to be copied or given to ANY other MUD or
{Rposted on ANY website without permission from Nisstyre.  The 
{Rbig man himself.
{x
{R3) Information in this book is NOT to be given to players on
{Rthe main port without permission from your head builder and/or
{Rany level 109 immortal.  This is a building guide and should
{Rbe reserved for builders ONLY.
{x
We want you to enjoy yourself and have fun building because that
it will be your reward to see the players on the main port having
fun in the confines of your brain child.  Ensure that you can 
keep building from now and into the future by taking your job
seriously!  There is no pay for this line of work, but there are
many hard working builders making Waterdeep the fun place that
it is.  Keep yourself counted among them!
{x
Last of all, we are all here to help one another.  If you have
a question, ask your fellow builders.  The only dumb question is
the one not asked.

{YYour Current Head Builder is: {WLuthic
{yIf you have any questions or concerns that are not answered
{yby this book or your fellow builders, or a question or concern
{ythat needs to be addressed privately, please note your head

First and foremost, to the players Mielikki and Sandra, who put

My personal thanks go out to Mageslair.net in addition to the 
above for having the best newbie builder guide out there, and 
countless websites for having information still available in
this age of MMORPG's.  It's great to have a place that still
relies on the wonders of reading and simple imagination to make
everything possible.

Thank you to Bane, Kord, Vorcet, and Io for answering questions 
when I had them, and to Nisstyre for keeping the doors open

These are the rules of the builder port.  Not knowing them isn't an 
excuse, especially when you have this book.  Always check back in on
this page to know if an update has been made!
{x
{G1) Only build in the zones {Ryou are assigned to {Gunless given permission
{Gby a 110 or your headbuilder. If your name isn't on it, don't edit it!
{x
{G2) Equipment should follow the guidelines put forth in the WDOLC with 
{Gthe anticipation that any equipment too powerful or potentially imbal-
{Gancing will require changes before your area is cleared to go live.
{x
{G3) Objects  should follow the guidelines  put forth in the WDOLC with
{Gthe anticipation that any object made too powerful or imbalanced {RWILL 
{Grequire  changes before your area is  cleared to go live.  If special
{Gcircumstances  apply, you will  need to speak  to your headbuilder to 
{Gclear them.
{x
{G4) Builders {Ware permitted {Gto stat items/mobs with the following excep-
{Gtions:
{x
{W* You may {RNOT {Wstat runs/run mobs/run mprogs/run gear/IQ items without
{W  permission from your headbuilder.
{W* You may {RNOT  {Wstat objects unless they  are {Rrelevant {Wto what you are
{W  creating. That means {RNO {Wstatting mobs/objs just to satisfy curiosity.
{x
{G5) Builders are permitted to go into areas with a security level of 10
{RONLY {Gto help with your own area.  Builders {Ware also permitted {Gto visit
{Gother  areas actively  being built  {Ywith the  consent  {Gof the  builder 
{Gcurrently working on that area.  ALL OTHER AREAS, {RINCLUDING {Grun areas/
{GIQ  areas/IMM areas are absolutely  off limits without permission from 
{Gyour headbuilder.  That means you may {RNOT {Gwander the builder port.  If 
{Gyou are in violation of this rule, you will be subject to punishment.
{x
{G6) Anything being  done on this port is considered confidential and it 
{Gis a  major violation  to discuss  any developments on  this port with 
{Gplayers of the main port.
{x
{G7) Builders must include all areas to which they are currently assigned 
{Gin their description. Builders without an area may note your headbuilder 
{Gor any 110 to request a new area and wait to be assigned.
{x
{YWe do not  pressure our builders with timelines or quotas to fill each 
{Yweek, but we do ask if  a builder is going to stop building or be away 
{Yfor an  extended period  of time, that  notification is  given to your 
{Yheadbuilder, this  would be any time of 2 or  more weeks that you will 
{Ybe away.  Failure  to do so may  result in  your builder being removed 
{Yfrom active duty and your area reassigned to someone else, or demolish-
{Yed.  {RThis is for ANY builder on this port.
{x
Last  of all, every builder  on this port is logged.  That does mean all 
that you say and do is visible to your headbuilder and other higher ups.  
Logs are checked to ensure that the rules are followed and the port runs 
smoothly.  Any infraction  on this port can  be carried to the main port 
on your mortal/immortal there.  Play it safe!

These are not rules, but mere observations that will help you on
your building journey.  Everyone has their own style of doing 
this job, and if you don't yet, you'll find ways that work best
for you.  In the meantime, here are a few suggestions that may
make your work easier.

{x
{GGraph Paper
{g  Ohhhh, just the name brings back memories of D&D, doesn't it?
{g  Many a builder uses the tried and true graph paper to lay out
{g  a design before actually building it.  (I can't tell you how 
{g  helpful it is to be able to see my vnums inside those beautiful
{g  little boxes - like my own private map to my area.  It also 
{g  allows you to see what you have before you go through the time
{g  and trouble of building it.  Countless times, I find I OVER
{g  estimate the size of an area given the vnums, and through my
{g  trusty graph paper, I can fix errors before I have to FIX
{g  errors.)

{x
{GBuilding a Skeleton.
{g  This is laying out the rooms without bothering to name them,
{g  flag them, describe them, or anything.  Just getting the
{g  foundation in place.
{x  
{x
{GFleshing it Out.
{g  This is a matter of personal tastes.  Some people make their
{g  mobs and objects first, others name the rooms and make their
{g  descriptions first.  Either one is fine, and is completely 
{g  up to you.  (I prefer naming my rooms, describing them, then
{g  filling them in so I have a completed shop/home/etc, but this
{g  is also depending on how I feel for the day.)
{x
  Remember:  Descriptions are important.  You don't have to
  write them out before hand unless you like working that way,
  but they should be lively and vivid and NOT roleplay for the
  player.  More on that in the guidelines section.

Handy dandy and an absolute necessity.  These are the commands that 
will allow you to do everything a builder will need to do.  If you 
have questions, remember, ask.  If you're not sure of a command, ask.
{x
{CPrompt
{c -This is the first thing you should change since you no longer need
{c  to be concerned about your hit points/mana and so on. As a builder, 
{c  you have other information you need to be concerned with. Though 
{c  you can later alter it to your wishes and desires, for beginners, 
{c  this is a good start.  Type in:
{x
prompt Area: %z | RVnum: %o | Editing Vnum: %R | Current Editor: %O
{x
{c  You will see now that the Area reads what area you are currently in,
{c  RVnum shows the room vnum you are currently in.  The other two will
{c  fill in when you're in the editors, which we will discuss in just a
{c  few pages.  Feel free to color your prompt as desired.
{x
{CHolylight
{c -Never be in the dark again.  Holylight will make it so you can see 
{c  no matter what.  All the cool immortals use it.  You want to be cool, 
{c  don't you?  Type holylight to toggle it on and off.
{x
{Cgset <vnum>
{c -This will let you have a room that you "goto" when you type in "go." 
{x
{Cgoto <vnum> (or go alone to use your gset location)
{c -Fancy way for you to "go" to whatever room you want.  You simply 
{c  need to know the vnum.  If you want to go to your gset location, 
{c  just type go.

{CSecurity {w- (See help security)
{c  -You may notice when you use alist that there is a small box
{c   toward the end of the line that looks like this:  [10].  That
{c   is a security rating, and it ensures that anyone without the
{c   proper security level is not able to edit that area.  For
{c   example, you could go into any area with your security and
{c   edit it.  (This is absolutely against the rules, just for the
{c   record - if your name isn't on it, don't touch it.)  The
{c   different numbers mean the following:
{c          1 - Builders who do not have mprog clearance
{c          2 - Builders who are able to use mprogs
{c          3 - Lead Builders

{c          8 - Areas inspected by head builder/needs mort testing
{c          9 - Head builder inspected, mort tested, needs 110 approval
{c         10 - Areas that are open on the main port for players.
{x
{CTime
{c  -It is useful to have a basic understanding of how ticks operate.
{c   First of all, ticks are randomized to a certain extent - so they
{c   are not always the same length.  This prevents predictability.
{c   What follows is a very general guideline for time passing:
{c          1 hour of game time = 5 ticks
{c          Each tick is roughly 1 minute of real time.
{c          Therefore: 1 hour of real time = approx. 60 ticks or 12 
{c                     game hours.
{x
{CMoney
{c  -The economy in Waterdeep is based on silver, gold, and platinum.
{c   When building mobs, you will only be using amounts in silver, so
{c   what follows is the conversion rate:
{c          100 silver = 1 gold
{c          100 gold   = 1 platinum
{c          Therefore: 10000 silver = 1 platinum, 1000000 = 100 platinum
{c   Please be careful when giving mobs money - we do not want to 
{c   flood the market and make platinum worthless (inflation).

{RPutting Stats/Affects on Equipment
{8-------------------------------------------------
{rSo special it gets its very own page.  Part of the fun in building
{ris making new gear for players to wear, but that is also part of
{rthe vast responsibility you wield.  {RTo put it bluntly - if you
{Runderpower an item, no one will use it, if you overpower an item,
{Ryou make other gear worthless.  
{x
{rThe following guidelines are for {WLEVELING {requipment only, that
{rmeans anything under level 101.  If you are making hero gear, or
{rare working on run equipment, you will want to stat other gear
{rto ensure that what you are creating does not negate everything
{relse out there.
{x
{rThere are always exceptions and here are a few.  {RYou should {WNOT 
{Rmake statted lip equipment, anklets, back items, tattoos, religious 
{Rsymbols, earrings, surrounding, instruments, ID, or rings without
{Rapproval from your head builder.  {rThese items are delicate and
{rtoo much on them could result in seriously imbalancing equipment
{rthat is already out there.  It is not to say that you CANNOT, but
{rthat without approval beforehand, or a good reason, you may have
to change your items come inspection time.
{x
{rA general rule of thumb is this:  {YBack = rare/hard  {YLip = Ultra rare
{Y/Ultra hard {R(no joints){Y, ID = no stats but needs purchase/really
{Ygood reasoning. {R(ID should be more for IMMs to use.){x

{rAll other slots mentioned above need to have balance as their
top priority.  Ask or stat other items of similar level to
help you make determinations on what you should do.

{rIt is worth stating that not everything needs stats/affects, nor
{rshould everything have it anyway.  You are working on a spider
{rweb where everything you do affects every other strand - use
{rcaution and wisdom and be judicial when statting equipment.

{rFinally, AC is currently NOT used on Waterdeep.  As such, there 
{ris little need to worry about using it and it will not have a
{rtable.

{w  -With all this talk about the good stuff, it is worth bringing up
{w   the bad stuff you can put on equipment.  By putting detriments on
{w   equipment, it balances the positives nicely.  For example, if you
{w   have a Illithid Skullcap that gives +5 intelligence, it could also
{w   cause blindness since the long tenticles would strap over your eyes.
{w   Mercury's Shoes could give +3 dex, but also give faerie fire.  The
{w   choice is yours, but using negatives to balance your equipment is

{RPutting Stats/Affects on Weapons
{8-------------------------------------------------
{rStill with me?  Great!  Now that you know what you can do 
{rwith statting equipment, it's time to discuss statting your
{rweapons.  Just as before, there are a few things to say when
{rdiscussing this topic.  Remember to have fun, but remember
{rto be responsible.  {RIf you underpower an item, no one will
{Ruse it, but if you overpower an item, you make all other
{Rweapons worthless.
{x
{rThe following guidelines are for {WLEVELING {rweapons only, that
{rmeans anything under level 101.  If you are making hero 
{rlevel weapons, or run prizes, you will want to stat other
{rweapons to ensure that what you are creating does not negate
{reverything else out there.
{x
{rPutting stats on your weapons is not necessary, and should
{rdefinitely be used sparingly if at all.  The more things you
{radd onto a weapon, the slower it will be to get your area
{rapproved, and may simply result in you having to redo items
{rto make them less powerful. 
{x
{rBe judicious, careful, and wise in your use of stats on
{rweapons to keep yourself out of trouble and clear of tangles
{rdown the line.

{w      2 handed = 1.5eqlevel +/-20 (depending on other stats)
{w
{wThe following are other stats you can place on equipment.  {RIf you
{Rput any of the following on a piece of equipment, consider lowering
{Rthe amount of damage done in order NOT to create an overpowered
{Rpiece of leveling gear.  {WESPECIALLY {Rflags.
{x
{WRolls:
{R -NOTE: Most leveling equipment does {WNOT {Ruse rolls, so it should
{R  be very rare if used at all.
{W      TOTAL rolls = weaponlevel/10
{w          For example, if I have a level 50 sword, I have 5 
{w          rolls total and could place hr2/dr3, dr5, or hr5.

{WStats:
{w -Again: This should {RNOT {wbe the norm and should be rare if used
{w  at all.  These are str/int/wis/dex/con.
{W      Weaponlevel/20. 
{w          Therefore: A level 60 weapon could have a total
{w          of 3 stats on it - 1str-1dex-1con, 2str-1dex, or 3str.
{x
{WFlags:
{w -These are additional flags that can be added to a weapon.  Please
{w  refrain from adding them without good reason, and if you're looking
{w  to add more than one, know that you will need approval.  {RNotice
{R  that most add damage or increase damage - take this into account
{R  when assigning an average damage to your weapon!
{x
{8      Flaming:  weapon is encased in fire, does damage, firebreath
{8      Frost:    weapon is encased in ice, does damage, chill affect
{8      Vampiric: weapon steals hitpoints from the victim
{8      Sharp:    weapon is sharp, INCREASES DAMAGE
{8      Vorpal:   weapon is vorpal, INCREASES DAMAGE
{8      Twohands: weapon is two handed (good disability for powerhitters)
{8      Shocking: weapon is encased in electricity, does damage
{8      Poison:   weapon is poison tipped, does damage, causes poison
{8      Negating: weapon randomly casts dispel magic (spell=to weapon lvl)
{8      Phasing:  weapon bypasses armor values
{x
{WSpells/Skills:
{w  -Weapons can actually have skills and spells added to them.  {RHOWEVER,
{w   this is such a rarity that for leveling equipment it is best left
{w   alone.  As such, it will not be covered here and should {RNOT{w be used.
{R   Hero/Run level equipment should be the {WONLY {Rweapons bearing added
{R   affects, and even then, they rarely do.

Welcome to the guidelines section.  These are a few guidelines
that will help us keep our mud on target with its theme, as 
well as ensure that the player who explores the areas has a
world that is rich and enjoyable.  These are not "rules" but
stand as very good standards and ideals to build by.  Enjoy!
{x
{MThe Dreaded "You"
{m  -One of the worst things visible on any mud is to have
{m   "you" in the descriptions.  Part of the issue with this
{m   is that it makes presumptions about the character and
{m   roleplays FOR them.  You might have a character who is
{m   evil, yet to say in the description, "You feel an aura
{m   of evil that shakes you to your core," would be a very    
{m   untrue statement indeed. 
{x
{MMobs in the Description
{m  -Yet another issue is when a mob is described in the room.
{m   The trouble with this comes about when a player clears
{m   out the room.  If you have described, "Hundreds of riders
{m   crest the hill, ready to slay anyone in their way," well...
{m   no they're not.  Keep mob descriptions on the mob, not in
{m   the rooms.
{x
{MWidth and Length
{m  -While it is tempting to write entire paragraphs to describe
{m   a room, the truth is, general rooms should be from 4-6 
{m   lines, saving longer descriptions for more important places.
{m   Width is also a consideration, a basic rule of thumb is as
{m   wide as the finger command - 70 characters at most.  This
{m   will prevent players from having to widen their screen just
{m   to see the room.
{x
{MFinal Fantasy 6, 7, and Forgotten Realms
{m  -Waterdeep is a themed mud, using mobs, items (with one
{m   notable exception), and places from Final Fantasy 6 and
{m   7, as well as Forgotten Realms.  Guns are the only items
{m   that need special permissions to be made.  Steampunk is
{m   also an element of the mud, and as such, you can create
{m   areas that reflect that aspect within the confines of the
{m   theme.  If you would like more information, find a fellow
{m   builder who can help you, or ask your head builder.
{x
{MColor!
{m  -Be judicious in your use of color and use it sparingly.
{m   If every room is an explosion of color, then special rooms
{m   you may create become less special.  This is not to say
{m   you can't use it at all, but if you truly want that evil
{m   dungeon sacrificial altar room to stand out, go easy on
{m   the colors until you get to that place and make it rock.
{x
{MSpellcheck
{m  -Use it!  If you are using Cmud as a client, it has a built
{m   in spellcheck.  If not, you can always copy and paste into
{m   a word document.  This will keep your area from looking
{m   amateur or just poorly done.  Let your hard work stand up
{m   to any test!  Proofread and spellcheck!

{yand I'm willing to bet you're itching to make more.  So, make sure
{yyou're in redit.  From here on out, you are "digging" new rooms in 
{ythe direction you want to go.  So, to make a new room, type:
{x
{Y<direction> dig <your next vnum>
{Yexample:  north dig 43000
{x
{yIf you get it right, it will show you that the room was created.
{x
{YWhat if that room already exists and I want to link it?
{W<direction> link <room vnum>
{Wexample:  north link 43000
{x
{YWhat if I only want a one way exit?
{W<direction> room <room vnum>
{Wexample:  north room 43000
{X
{YWhat if I want to make a door on that exit?
{W<direction> door <door flag>  (For a list of flags, type ? exit)
{Wexample: north door closed locked 
{R>>>>{yDoor flags toggle on and off, if you type north door closed again, it will
{y    remove the door and the closed!  Below is a list of door flags and what
{y    they do:
{W    door:  {8Makes a door.  You MUST have this to use any of the other flags.

{YWhat if I want to make a key for the door?
{W<direction> key <key vnum>

So you've laid out your rooms and got yourself a super awesome
area all ready for the next steps.  Congrats!  Now comes the
section of the guide that tells you how to make stuff for your
area.  The good times are about to get better.
{x
Before we begin there are a couple things to note.  Back/Lip
and ID items require special consideration.  As well as anklets
tattoos, religious symbols, earrings, surrounding, and instrument.
{YIf you are planning on making these - {W[{BRead Helping2{W] {Ybefore
{Yyou start.  These have guidelines that must be followed to get
approval!{x
{x
First we should note that your vnums for objects are the same
as your vnums for rooms, which will be the same vnums for mobs.
What this means is that within a given range (say 43000-43099)
you have 100 vnums for rooms numbered 43000-43099, 100 vnums
for objects numbered 43000-43099, and 100 vnums for mobs numb-
ered 43000-43099.  So when you create your objects, you don't
have to worry about your rooms matching up or vice versa.
{x
{YType in: {Roedit create <your first vnum>
{x
This opens the editor and creates your first object.  How
exciting!  This is how you create any and every object in
your area.  Let's find out what you can do. 
{x
{M=======
{C1. Show
{C   Syntax: s (or just hit enter)
{m-------
{c   This will bring up your editor and show you the stats you 
{c   have on your object.  The fields here are a little different
{c   from redit, so keep reading to find out what they do.
{x
{M=======
{C2. Commands
{C   Syntax: commands
{m-------
{c   Just like before, typing in commands will show you a list of
{c   commands you can use within oedit.  Some will be useful, 
{c   some will not, and some may not even be implemented yet.  We
{c   will cover the most used ones here.
{x
{M=======
{C3. Name
{C   Syntax: name <insert name>
{C   Example: name golden fleece
{m-------
{c   This sets the name of the object which is DIFFERENT from what
{c   the player sees.  This should contain keywords for the player,
{c   so if you make a "baton of rat bashing" name would contain:
{c   baton rat bashing.

{x
{M=======
{C4. Short
{C   Syntax: short <insert string>
{C   Example: a baton of rat bashing
{M-------
{c   This is what the player sees with the item in their inventory.
{c   Do NOT capitalize the a/an!  Otherwise, when a player wears
{c   your item, it will say, "You wear A baton of rat bashing..."
{c   This short string should go into a sentence.  Only capitalize
{c   proper nouns/titles - just like any good english sentence.
{x
{M=======
{C5. Long
{C   Syntax: long <insert string>
{C   Example: A baton of rat bashing lays here, forgotten.
{m-------
{c   This is what shows up if the player is NOT holding the item
{c   and it is on the floor or just in the room.
{x
{M======
{C6. ED
{C   Syntax: e add <keyword>
{C           e edit <keyword>
{C           e delete <keyword>
{C           e format <keyword>
{m------
{c   This is the same as the extra descriptions in the room, but
{c   it is on your object.  This is nice if you want your player
{c   to see more than just the long description when they use
{c   'look item.'
{x
{M=======
{C7. Type
{C   Syntax: type <type>
{C   Example: type weapon
{m-------
{c   Type is what kind of object you are making.  To see a full
{c   list in the editor, type: ? type.  Below is a list of imp-
{c   lemented types:

So here we are, ready to create and populate your area with
the denizens that call it home.  But how do you make them?
Well, join me on the journey and find out!
{x
To create your first mob, you will need to type:
{x
{Rmedit create <your first vnum>
{x
And like magic, you are in the editor, staring at a brand
new life waiting to be born.  As with any editor, typing s
or just hitting return will show you all the stats for the

{8Druid        Mob has druid skills
{8No_body      Mob will not leave a corpse
{8Nobd_drop    Mob will drop everything at death (use with no_body)
{R              NOTE: {wnobd_drop will also make a mob see through

{Y12. Affect Flags
{Y    Syntax: aff <flags>
{Y    Example: aff hide pass_door sneak
{r-------
{y    These are the flags that enable your mob to do various things because

{Y    Syntax: form <flags>
{Y    Example: form animal biped mammal
{r-------
{y    The form flag is a determination of what kind of corpse your mob will 
{y    leave behind, and whether or not it is edible.  Sometimes this is pre
{y    set when you pick a race, other times you can add and edit.  Type ? form

{Y18. Offensive Flags
{Y    Syntax: off <flag>

{Y21. Start/Default position
{Y    Syntax: position <start/default> <position>
{Y    Example: position start sitting
{r-------
{y    The start position is the position the mob will be loaded in, default 
{y    is what it will do once it is done fighting.  Sleeping default will not
{y    happen.  Positions are: standing, sitting, resting, sleeping.

{Y    Syntax: silver <number>
{Y    Example: silver 1000
{r-------
{y    See {W[{BRead Helping1{W] {yfor a money conversion table.  Mobs should not be
{y    laden with money without very good reason.  A rule of thumb is {RNO MORE
{y    than 100 silver a level.  This means at level 100, your mob will drop
{y    10000 silver (1 platinum).  Keep in mind, animals (rabbits, foxes, etc)
{y    really shouldn't drop money.  Leave it for the sentient mobs.
{x
{R=======
{Y23. Special Functions (Spec)
{Y    Syntax: spec <spec flag>
{Y    Example: spec spec_breath_frost
{r-------
{y    These are ways to make your mob a little tougher than normal, but you
{y    should also use spec flags VERY sparingly, especially the lower the
{y    level of your mob.  In general, level 80+ mobs would be a better fit
{y    for a spec than a low level when using damage specs.  ? spec will 
{y    bring up a list in editor, to see what they do {W[{BRead Mobflags3{W]{y.
{x
{R=======
{Y24. Short
{Y    Syntax: short <string>
{Y    Example: short a disembodied head
{r-------
{y    This is what is seen when the mob does something or in combat.  Like
{y    other short strings, it should only be capitalized if it is a proper
{y    noun, and do {RNOT {ycapitalize the first letter unless it is a name.
{x
{R=======
{Y25. Long
{Y    Syntax: long <string>
{Y    Example: long A disembodied head floats here, waiting to strike!
{r-------
{y    This should be what the player will see if they enter the room with
{y    the mob.  It should stick to one sentence in length.
{x
{R=======
{Y26. Description
{Y    Syntax: desc
{r-------
{y    This is what the player will see if they look at the mob.  3-6 lines
{y    should be enough here, and should be descriptive.  You may use color
{y    here if you wish.

Here on Waterdeep it takes a level of 106 to be able to create and
implement mprogs on your mobs.  As such, there is so much on the 
topic it requires another book! 
{x
If you are not level 106, you will need to not only show you are a
dedicated builder to get to 106, but will need to begin reading up
on what makes mprogs tick.  You can load our mprog guide to begin
studying.  {WLoad obj <vnum unknown>
{x
In the meantime, being too low to create your own mprogs does NOT mean
that you cannot have them.  You will simply need a level 106 to help 
you create them and put them on your mobs.  If you have an idea for
something, ask for the help.  With time and patience, you may find 
yourself creating your very own mprogs for Waterdeep.
{x
If you are already 106 - load the book and get crackin!

{x
And here we get to the bread and butter, the one thing that
stands between your building a bunch of stuff, and your having
an area that is populated with that bunch of stuff - resets.
{x
Resets are what you put in place to tell the mud that you
really DO want your stuff to show up.  You tell it how many
of what, in what order, and whether it is on a mob or inside
a container.  Resets make the mud go.
{x
During a reset, the area executes all the commands at once.
It is reset when the server loads (reboots), as well as
periodically as it "ages," which is roughly 3 minutes if
no one is in the area, or 15 if they are.  (Minute = 60-90
seconds.  See {W[{BRead Helping1{W]{w for time.)
{x
Basically there are 6 things do with reset commands:
* load a mob/mobs into a room
* load an object into the room
* put an object in an object
* give/equip a mob with an object
* door resets (currently not available)
* randomized exits
{x
There is also an order that the resets should follow:
{R1) object in the room
{y2) container object in the room 
{Y3) object/objects stored within the container within the room 
{G4) mobs within the room
{B5) object/objects on the mob in the room
{M6) container object the mob has 
{m7) object/objects stored within a container that the mob has 
{x
Each reset will be given a number, visible when you type "resets"
in the room.  They load in order from one on up.
{x
So, how do you do it?  Well let's get started.

{WRegarding Damage{x
{x
Here is where I make a humble suggestion.  If you aren't ready to have
your mind blown, you probably shouldn't be on this page.  The formula
for figuring damage isn't necessarily difficult, but it is a journey
into the bowels of code, then an exercise in patience, and a dash of
frustration.  But hey, what would life be without that one little monkey
wrench to make it interesting?
{x
The formula per the code goes like this:
{cdam = diceroll(x,y)

{cif ( enhanced_damage ) dam += 2 * (dam * chance / 300)

{cdexmod = <-125 to 125>
{cac_app = (+AC + dexmod) / 10
{cac_app += ac_app / 2
{x
{cdamroll_app = damroll * skill / 100
{x
{cdam += Minimum(0, damroll_app - ac_app)
{x
{cif ( dam > 35 ) dam = ( dam - 35 ) /2 + 35
{cif ( dam > 80 ) dam = ( dam - 80 ) /2 + 80
{x
{cif ( sanc )   dam = dam / 2
{cif ( invoke ) dam = dam / 2
{x
{cif ( protection ) dam = dam - (dam / 4)
{x
{cif ( immune )    dam = 0
{cif ( resistant ) dam = dam - (dam / 3)
{cif ( vulnerable) dam = dam + (dam / 2)
{x
{cResult dam > Actual damage dealt
{x
{wThe hell what? you say?  Indeed.  Allow me to break this down
{wfor you and hopefully erase confusion.  There are only a few
things that you, as a builder, need to be aware of within this
tiny snippet of code.
{x
In loose terms, the bonus rolls in damage (the + number after the dice),
are immediately affected by the AC and Dex a character fighting your 
mob has.  So, lets say your player has an AC of -300 and a dex of 25.
You would first divide AC by ten and make it absolute.  300/10 = 30.
Then add your dexterity.  30+25 = 55.
{x
You take your bonus, (Say your mob had 12d40+300), and subtract the 
number from the player's AC+Dex:  300-55=245.  Now we will add this
in with the damage using the average:  12d40=147 + 245 = 392.  That is
the damage your mob did this round with the bonus, minus the AC/Dex factor.
{x
Now for the fun.  Since your damage is over 35, the mud halves it:
392/2=196.

Since it is over 80, the mud halves it again:
196/2=98
{x
If your player has sanc on, the mud halves the damage again:
98/2=49

If they have holy invoke, another half:
49/2=24.5
{x
If they are resistant or vulnerable, the damage is divided further,
by 3 or 2, respectively.
{x
After all that, the damage finally lands.  So why do you care?  Because
this will affect how your bonuses are calculated, as they are NOT straight
forward!  It is not a simple <dice>d<dice>+bonus.
{x
If you are confused, fear not - simply use the default stats chart in
this book {W[{BRead Defaultstats1{W]{w, which will help you create mobs
that are currently being used to level.  This page WILL help those who
are creating Run level mobs in determining their damage.

{R1) Loading an object into the room
{RSyntax: reset <number> obj <ovnum> room
{x
{r-Reset tells the mud you are resetting something
{r-Number places the reset at that position in the reset list.
{r-Obj informs the mud it's an object
{r-Ovnum tells the mud the vnum of the object
{r-Room tells the mud to load it into the room.
{x
{R>>Example:  {Wreset 1 obj 4300 room
{x
{y2) Loading a container in the room
{y(See #1, this reset it the same syntax)
{x
{Y3) Loading an object(s) in the container
{YSyntax: reset <number> obj <ovnum> inside <container vnum>
{x
{y-Inside tells the mud this reset will go inside something
{y-Container Vnum is the container's vnum you reset before this one
{x
{Y>>Example: {Wreset 3 obj 4302 inside 4301
{x
{G4) Loading a mob(s) into the room
{GSyntax: reset <number> mob <mvnum> <max # of mobs> <min # of mobs>
{x
{g-Max # of mobs tells the mud how many mobs to populate at most
{g-Min # of mobs tells the mud how few mobs to populate
{x
{G>>Example: {Wreset 4 mob 4300 12 3
{x
{g(This means in this room, a minimum of 3 mobs will spawn.  If
{gI don't reset them anywhere else, it will go up to 12.  If I 
{gput this reset in 4 rooms, for example, it will load 3 mobs in
{geach room, for a total of 12.)
{x
{B5) Loading objects on your mob
{BSyntax: reset <number> obj <ovnum> <none/slot>
{x
{c-None/Slot tells the mud *where* to reset the object.
{x
{B>>Example: {Wreset 5 obj 4304 face
{x
{cLet's say you want a mob to wear an item.  You can place that
{citem in one of the following slots:
{8neck1   neck2   legs   shield   rwrist   lwrist   face   ear
{8lance   clan    light  feet     about    wielded  tattoo lfinger
{8rfinger body    hands  waist    back     ankle    head   arms
{8hold    relig   floating        surrounding
{x
{RNOTE: {cYour mob WILL use the stats from weapons/armor, so take
{cthis into account when having your mobs wear/wield anything.
{cWhen they die, unless you have an mprog that destroys it, the
{cmob will drop its item for players to loot.
{x
{cOr, you can say "none."  This is what you use when making a

{x
{M6/7)Loading a container the mob has
{x
{mUsing the resets described above, this is easy.  You will need
{mto load the container onto your mob, then the next reset should
{mbe the item in the container.  It would look something like:
{x
{Wreset 1 mob 4300 1 1
{Wreset 2 obj 4301 none (or a slot on the mob)
{Wreset 3 obj 4302 inside 4301
{x
{mThis means your mob could be holding a gem pouch and inside the
{mpouch would be an emerald.  If you wanted more than one thing in
{mthe pouch, you simply add another reset with "inside" on it.
{x
{RLASTLY
{wAnother reset you can use is to randomize exits.  If you set a
{wroom to randomize, be aware, it is work to UNDO it.  Just taking
{wthe reset off does NOT realign your rooms.  So think carefully
{wbefore you use this.
{x
{WSyntax: reset <number> random <# of exits to randomize>
{x
{wSo if you're in a room with 2 exits and you want both to be
{wrandomized (maze), you would type:
{x
{Wreset 5 random 2
{x
{RGET IT OFF, GET IT OFF, GET IT OFF!
{x
{rDon't want a reset any longer?  Need to change it?  To delete
{ryour resets, type resets to see what number the hated reset is,
{rthen: 
{x
{Rreset <number> delete

{gThe question lingers on the air and the truly gnarly sign
quest rolls itself out into the light... truly... evil.{x
{x
{8Ladies and Gentlemen, I unveil the IstusQuest Sign Quest
version 4.0.  Here are the rules:
{x
{W*Each sign has TWO sentences.  The FIRST letter of EACH
 sentence is a letter in a question.
{W*{YEach sign ALSO has a symbol which you NEED to prove you
 saw the sign first hand (or with your group).
{W*{GAssemble the letters to form the question, then answer
 it.
{W*{gSend me a note with the clues, the symbols on each sign,
 the completed question, and the answer to the question.
{x
{RThis sign quest will go on until it is solved. {rSo don't
worry about time other than to be the first to finish.  If
you give up, send me what you have, but note that if you
send me a note quitting, you can't keep playing!  So don't
give up unless you REALLY want to!
{x
{8Whadafuq?
{wNeed an example?  Here ya go:
{x
Hiding in the garden. I wink at you. ##
Holding a plum in hand.  Outside the door.  &&
Where I am sitting.  Air is sweet.  ^^
Rolling waves go by.  Early birds fly.  **
Years of dust.  Open to the public.  @@
Understand?  ?  ))
{x
The first letters of each sentence spell out:
Hi.  How are you?
{x
You would write me a note with the clues as above,
then the question they make.  Then the answer.
{x
{WThere will be a First, Second, and Third place,
and a small gift for all others who participate.
What fun would this birthday party be without gifts?
{x
You may work in groups if you wish or alone.
{x
Enjoy.  >:D
