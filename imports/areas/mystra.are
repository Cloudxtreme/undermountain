Dragons? Splendid things, lad...so long as ye look upon them
only in tapestries, or in masks worn at revels, or from about
three realms off....
 
Astragarl Hornwood, Mage of Elembar
said to an apprentice
Year of the Tusk
 
 
To chain a mage? Why, the promise of power and knowing secrets
('magic' if you will), greed, and love... the things that chain all
men... and some of the more foolish women, too.

The Cure for the Curse of the Cyrinshad
 
*When casting this spell the mage or priest must hold the holy
symbol of Mystra upon the chest of the strickened. It is advised
that the strickened be held for the pain of the holy object against
the rot the Cyrinshad has started will be painful. After the holy
symbol of Mystra is laid upon the chest of the strickened these
words the priest or mage must chant*

A written interview with the goddess, Mystra.
Author: Unknown but was affiliated with Those Who Harp
 
By Ao, child it has been long since I have laughed so hard.
I believe that my destiny upon this plane is to enhance man
rather than destroy it. To love them as a mother to her newborn
babe on her breast. My life is a hard one child. I dont think any
sane person wishes to be immortal. The constant suffering you 
must bare. The eternal injustices you must watch as the very
thing you love most of all slips through you fingers. I fight
a battle on two fronts. One with the Dark Sun, the other, the
Destroyer. Both wish to harness my awesome power. Fools....
They lack the capability to maintain the weave. If they even 
laid their vile hands upon the loose fabric of magic this multiverse
would tumble down upon our heads.OH NO! I must go child
 Cyric is trying to free the Chaos Hound.

In our towers do we seek, for the magic we do believe.
 Planes not known to mortal man we enter through the
 portal lands. She has molded and enhanced man. O'Mystra!
 O'Mystra! We beg of your hand. Please come down to our
 lives, our people seek your immortal wise. You who protects
 the eternal weave. We beg of you protect us in our eve.

May it be known that I shall never leave you my children.
Always am i at your side protecting you
Always am I teaching you
Always I love you
Be you evil, good, or neutral I am your guide
From my thoughts I have taken the magicks of god and mortal
and have brought them back
I am the ultimate spell
I am the ultimate mystery.
The words of Mystra - Told by the deceased prophet Morus Lo Siew.

As you should know Mystra does not block access the way of magic if your evil or
 good. Magic is for all. Magic has no eyes, it has no ears. It is a instrument.
The Bible of Azuth. Revealings 1:3 
 
*laughs carelessly* Child do not be afraid. I am Mystra. I am here, because you 
have potential...
- Mystra Lady of Mysteries
 
 
Let magic surround you. Let it fill you with the glory of Mystra herself. For sh
e is ever present in magic, even the other gods.

The Words of Mystra:
 
I who have given you of myself.. ask only one thing
that you love magic. Not only as a tool but as a art.
It is my gift to you so that you may thrive. So that
you maybe able to search the world and find hidden things
Love it as I love you.
 
- Mystra Lady of Mysteries

Come ye, Come ye, Come ye,
All my magi, you who are me,
Come ye, Come ye, Come ye,
All the children of the weave,
Come ye, Come ye, Come ye,
See the wonders I can show thee,
 
See the wonders I can show thee,
Feel the mana upon your sleeve,
Feel the power of magic tonight,
Feel the grace of my love this night,
 
Love me for I am with you,
For I love you my magi true.

In ancient days, sorcerers sought to learn the One True Spell that
would give them power over all the world and understanding of
all magic. Some said they'd found it but such men were usually
dismissed as crazed.
 
I saw one of these 'crazed' mages myself. He could ignore
spells cast at him as if they did not exist, or work any magic him-
self by silent thought alone. I did not think he was mad.. but at
peace, driven by urges and vices no longer, He told me the One
True Spell was a woman, that her name was Mystra... and that
her kisses were wonderful.

sounds of a group of children playing "Knights and Villains." For a
minute you are taken back to your childhood but soon get back on your
way to find your final destination. Whatever that maybe.
To the east of you, you see a entrance to a large hedge maze.
Appearing far in the distance is a tower glowing with the auras of blue and white.

Ridge Overlooking A Magnificent Tower~
~
The path ends here at the edge of a ridge overlooking a shallow
valley drop.  A dark haze bellows in the shallow valley below, as if
shrouding some great secret.  Jutting from the haze is a magnificent
spiraling tower of white iridescence.  A precarious drop downward
leads into the haze, though it seems to be the only way of reaching
that tower...

This small booth seems the most unlikely place to set up a trinket

long tunic stands behind his booth, peddling trinkets of all manner. 
He doesn't seem the vendor type, with long hair and moderately thick
leather armor, and a longsword fitted to his hip.  Indeed this setup
looks only to be temporary.

midwife, surgeon, and healer of both man and beast in the dale.
She has the healing proficiency, backed up by those healing magics 
and potions as are made available by Lord Mourngrym.

of peace and treaty. A beautiful geothermal lake has
been transported here allegedly by Mystra herself
from Mount Celestia herself. A large table filled with
a great variety of foods is here and Hanei the temple
maid is here ready to provide you with anything you need.

Hall of True Mystery~
~
One of the more popular rooms of the church it is held
as one of the greater mysteries of all of Faerun. You walk
around the room as the tiles of the floor constantly change
from blue to white and the walls seem to be in constant movement
An illusion of Mystra revolves upon a pedastal as she dances
a strange and exotic dance. The very air here is dark as the
mist of the Island of Mystra's dance engulfs to room. As
you wander around the grand room you start to hear strange music
and begin to dance to it unconsciously. Suddenly your surrounded
by others who are enthralled by the music. You begin dancing in a
frenzy until you drop in exhaustion and rest.

Hall of Silent Contemplation~
~
The Hall of Silent Contemplation was created so
the followers of Mystra could think and meditate
on the proper uses of spell conduct and spell 
manipulation. Several bamboo mats litter the floor
with small pitchers of hot and cold water on each side.
A strange silence permeates throughout the air in a fascinating
way...

Hall of Gentle Heart~
~
As you enter the Hall of Gentle Heart you suddenly
feel a great compassion toward your fellow man. You
wish to help them as much as they have probably helped
you. You begin to wonder why you have taken so much yet
have not given back. You begin to wonder why your wondering
this.

Priest's Cells~
~
These cells not particurlarly beautiful were
meant for the servants of Mystra. A few paintings
of loved ones lay upon the walls and beds are arranged
in a neat row for those wishing to sleep. Basically
theres no use seeing this room if your not related to
any of Mystra's followers.

Palace of Torm the True~
~
Not exactly the most decadent palace, you can see
that Torm likes things to be simple. In the middle of
palace a grand golden throne fills up most of the room
as loyal followers aid their lord in daily jobs. A few
tapestries hang upon the walls, but nothing much.

magnificent library.. Filled with every book made in the realms, this
palacial library dwarves even the greatest of the ancient libraries.
In the center of this paradise to sages and scholar lays a great and
magnificent pool that seems to be resting place of Oghma the Wise..

Temple's Aids Room~
~
This small room is very light decorated and sparcely furnished.
Built by an ancient highpriest, Epsilon, he has dedicated this
room to his goddess and to the teaching and to the aid of others
as the church's dogmatic laws dictates.

As you enter the groves of Silvanus in the outlands you find your suddenly
surrounded by thousands upon millions of woodland creatures, mythical and ones
that you have seen all the time. Large halls of interwoven wood still in it's
ground make a huge palace. So very.. very.. woodsy.

A place where only a deity may go this huge stable is magnificent in
beauty and architecture.  Incredibly large, carved rowen gates magically
hold the immortal mounts, as they buck and ninny.  Truly amazing..  Maybe
the last miracle you will ever see....

There is nothing in the known realms more...  Vast than this room. 
The raw infinite reach of space seems to explode in all directions. 
There is no visible floor, however, there is a deep {Bblue carpet{7 and an
{*Ebony Throne {7in the near reach.  A path seems to be marked by
flickering, mystical pale blue flames.  What would happen if one were
to walk off the marked path....?  Would you dare find out?

This large festhall seems to be..  Well..  It seems to be located on the
moon, Selune, itself...  Made of crystal blocks that seem to be connected by
the power of weave-granted magic, this hall is coveted by a large cherrywood
table that sits hundreds.  At the backside of the hall connects a burning
fireplace that heats this room from the coldness of space.  In the middle of
the table is a hollowed out circle that contains a small fountains of a blue
icy liquid that you presume will cool your throat as soon as your drink the
magnificent stuff.

Master Bedroom~
~
The luxurious room is draped from the ceiling in multicolored
silks, covering and obscuring everything in the room.  Almost like a
maze of silks, to play in.  There is a bed, in the near middle, which
acts as a helix, for the coloured silks.  The other furniture of the
room, and dimensions, lay inconceivable to the mind.

Great glassed skylines form a fantastic view of the starry sky,
with a tremendous view of the Hal Nebula.  Whisps of ionic clouds
dancs an amorphic dance as the {Rc{^o{@l{%o{#u{&r{Rs{7 change and shift, from
solarizes, to pastels, and back again.  The water itself, lighted and
synthesized to change {Rc{^o{@l{%o{#u{&r{Rs {7also, throws beautiful refractions onto
the walls.  
 
Poolchairs and Tables line the walkways, and gentle motif-effect water
falls through the elaborate aquaduct system, designed for a soothing effect.
