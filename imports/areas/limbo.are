With a stern expression and a slight 5-o'clock shadow, he returns
your look and studies you closely.  His piercing brown eyes are sharp

he is well built, thick arms bulging in the arms of his shirt.  A
short sword hangs at his side, never far from the reach of his
thick-fingered hands.  Scars adorn him, speaking of past battles won.

You stand in a large court room, cut from the very rock that makes
the core of the planet.  The ceiling is smooth grante, with lights
hanging down from wires, glowing brightly.  Rows of benchs strech
towards the west, towards a large wood Judge desk, and the witness
stand.  On the walls, small alcoves cut into the stone walls, and a
statue of each god stands, Cyric, Nisstyre, Talos, Teron, Selune,
Tempus, Moradin, Kossuth, and Hanali.  You are here for justice, and
justice only.
