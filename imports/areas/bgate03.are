A warm hearth greets all who enter the Elfsong Tavern.  This is the
largest and most famous tavern in all of Baldur's Gate.  It is famous
for the ghost that noone can see, and gave the name to this tavern. 
She is said to sing a haunting melody most nights, but noone knows
why.  Travellers can rent rooms in the southeast corner of the tavern,
and buy a drink from the bar over on the west side.

over the top of the fireplace is a large beholder, that has been
killed, and embalmed, and hung over the fireplace like a statue. 
There is a sign at this table indicating that the man who is here
drinking from a jug of mead is the innkeeper.

Laughter and music can be heard through the tavern as many locals
and travellers of a plethora of races enjoy a drink and good company. 
A few locals sit at the table here along the east side of the tavern
discussing many an inane topic.  Bright lanterns shine light into the
tavern from the walls here, casting eerie shadows all around.

patrons.  Paintings line the walls, showing images of Baldur's Gate
from long ago.  One in particular stands out.  It is a beautiful elven
woman watching as her husband leaves for battle.

This is the back of the Elfsong Tavern.  There is a window in the
north wall looking out onto a dimly lit alley.  There is the
occasional voice coming from somewhere, kind of like someone singing a
sad song.  Looking southward, it is possible to see the whole of the
tavern, from the bar at the western side of the inn to the exit at the
south.

This is the centre of the tavern.  From all around, there is a
general hussle and bussle of a popular tavern.  Laughter and
conversations are coming from the many locals and travellers in the
tavern.  To the west you can find the bar, where the barmaid, and
owner of the tavern will greet you with a smile.  Every now and again,
there is an eerie voice, that sings a haunting but beautiful melody. 
Where could it come from?

This corner of the Elfsong Tavern is where the bar can be found. 
Many a weary traveller can be found at the bar, drinking away their
troubles.  There are also several citizens of Baldur's Gate at the bar
and are a good source of gossip and information.  To the west, behind
the bar, there is a small passageway that leads down to the cellars. 
There are many tables and other patrons of the tavern to the west, and
over to the north, a staircase leads up to the rooms for rent.

windows to let in any light.  The walls are made from fine pine wood
panels, like much of the rest of the Tavern.  There is a hatch in the
floor leading down into the cellars underneath the elfsong.  The only
other exit is north through the door leading back to the main bar

This is a high quality room designed for travelling merchants. 
There is a large footlocker at the end of the bed in this room, so
that the merchants who use it can store their wares while they sleep
in safety.  A small window overlooks the alleyways behind the tavern
to the north.

This corner of the tavern is not so well lit.  There is a small
table tucked away in the southwest corner of the corridor with a small
lantern on the table.  The corridor runs to the west, where people
with the right amount of money can rent a room.  These rooms are well
known for their safety and travellers always speak of the good rest
they get here.

This is a fairly small room.  There is a small desk and a single
bed, big enough for a large human, perhaps, in the centre of the back
wall.  The floor is made from polished wood, and is pretty clean. 
This is a nice enough room, but doesn't seem to have the luxury of the
merchant's room or the royal suite.

This is the largest of all the Elfsong's rooms.  There is a roaring
fireplace warming the room, and in the centre is a large four poster
bed with silk sheets and delicate and elegant silk curtains
surrounding it.  There are gold framed paintings on the wall,
depicting the various lords of Baldur's Gate throughout the years.
