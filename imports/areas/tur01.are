The  situation has not  changed much yet, 
people are still scared of  both temples. 
The spirits of  the fallen roam about the 
path towards the first temple, not a very 
cheering  sight.  Until the  whole temple 
has been searched, none  of the villagers 
will  come  one step closer to  the ruins 
than absolutely necessary for him or her.{x

A few brave  heroes and  Vectorian guards 
tried to investigate  the second  temple. 
Only  a few returned, describing horrible 
scenes. They  told the villagers that the 
heroes, the  priests and the  bandits, or 
at  least what was  left of them,  looked 
like  they  were  torn  to  pieces by  an 
extremely  powerful  and  immoral  force.

The bandits stayed and  hid themselves in 
the temple.  Vectorian troops  arrived in 
the town and started to  guard the access 
roads. Any  attempts to regain the temple 
were unsuccessful. The  citizens lived in 
fear, hidden in their houses. Some people 
left. 
{*
It became  even worse when the  merchants 
started to use  other routes, because the 
trade  route near Tru was too  dangerous. 
In the next  months the  Vectorian guards 
were  slowly withdrawn  from  the  region 
near Tru.  The village was  no longer  an 
important trade  post, so not interesting 
anymore.

Only a few  months ago, during the night, 
it  was  again  attacked,   now  by  much 
powerful forces. The bandits, descendants 
of Monzuka,  suddenly  came  out  of  the 
forest,  riding on  large  war  dogs  and 
accompanied  by even  larger beasts of an 
unknown kind.  The huge  beasts  trampled 
the  priests who  tried to flee or fight. 
The bandits  soon conquered  the  temple, 
there  was not much  of a fight,  for the 
temple was  only guarded by a few priests 
during this night.

The surviving priests,  together with the 
citizens,  collected money to build a new 
temple.  They did  not have  the means to 
remove the old one and decided to keep it 
as a memorial. The second temple was even 
larger  then the first one,  but with the 
help of hired  workers,  the  temple  was 
completed  quite fast. It  was more  then 
able t o provide  enough room to the many 
faithful of  Hanali in the region of Tru.{x

All  this good fortune  suddenly ended in 
the year 1193.  In this year,  a group of 
bandits under  the leadership of Monzuka, 
attacked and looted the temple of Hanali. 
Afterwards they destroyed  it with a very 
powerful  spell.  It  is still  suspected 
that another Deity was behind this spell, 
since  it is not  likely any mortal,  not 
even  a  powerful  member  of the  Wizard 
Council, would  be   powerful  enough  to 
destroy a temple of this  dimensions. The 
village was only  lightly damaged and was 
soon  repaired,  but the  damage  to  the 
sacred temple of Hanali was  irreparable.{x

Many years passed without any problems or 
significant events. The villagers became 
richer and richer and soon a city council 
was  formed.  With  the raised  taxes and 
dues,  a temple  dedicated  to the elvish 
Goddess  Hanali was  build, not far north 
of  the village.  People from  the  whole 
region  met at  the  temple, not only  to 
worship,  but also to  catch up with each 
other. Time  passed by and  the villagers 
lived  together  in peace  and happiness.{x

{wI hope he is right,  they seem  rather indomitable.  I have much faith  in Zoliar, {x

{wI have seen it happen.  A wild Behemoth  was routed by a  few of my man and Zoliar {x
{wmanaged  to cast a  powerful  charming spell on it.  The Behemoth  tried to resist {x
{wbut was soon submissive to Zoliar. It looks like it is time to carry out our plan. {x

{wready to strike, Polak isnt so sure yet.  He believes the Vectorians will hunt us 
{wdown and  crush us after  the attack.  He might be right.  Zoliar promised  me the 
{wBehemoths  will protect us against any  enemy and reminded me that we have managed 
{wto  hide from  them so far,  but as  Polak legitimately  remarked  that  is mainly 
{wbecause we havent caused much serious trouble so far.{x

{wI have been reading a small dairy of Monzuka today. He was a brave man, but he was 
{waided by a  powerful God.  I think Zoliar  is right.  He showed me the  power of a 
{wBehemoth today.  Even Qwartaz looked impressed and the last  time I have seen that 
{wwas  many years ago. Zoliar said he could charm only two, unfortunately. I am sure 
{wthat is  enough to raid  the temple, but I  am more  worried about  the days after 
{wthat, if there will be any.

{wPolak  and Zoliar  have made a battle plan  together.  It looks like  they finally 
{wagree. The main idea is not very surprising,  but it might actually work. With the 
{wBehemoth  on our side,  it  will be  no  problem to  raid  the  temple,  but Polak 
{wsuggested taming  a band of wolves. They would make excellent mounts. With them we 
{wwould be able to  leave the temple. Killing those  guards first is also an option, 
{wbut that  would only unleash hell.  The Empire  of Vector would  not rest till the 
{wdeath of their guards was avenged.

{wToday is the day, everybody is ready.  The morale is high and  everybody is really

{wusual loot a  temple  in a rich  village has.  The men  dont care much  about the

{wNO TREASURES! DAMNIT! The whole attack went perfectly. We caught them by surprise,
{wsuddenly  rushing  up towards  the temple  from the forest.  The few  priests that 
{wresisted were  killed before they  could alarm the guards in the village.  The men 
{wsearched the whole  temple and actually found a secret  part in the catacombs. But 
{wno treasures that are worth anything. They are on the edge. I decided, or actually 
{wwas forced,  to stay and keep searching for  any other hidden treasure rooms. They 
{wcant believe there is  nothing here but books and  neither can I.  Polak tries to 
{wcalm  down the men, but he is having  a hard time hiding  his own anger and doubt. 
{wZoliar.  Well Zoliar is a person  I never fully  understood and although  I always 
{wfully trusted him, he acts very strange since we found out there were no treasures 
{where. Polak said he saw him whispering with some of the officers as well.  I dont 
{wblame him actually,  everybody knows this is our only chance.  If we leave without 
{wany treasure, the men will mutiny and then all chances we will survive against the 
{wVectorian  troops are swept  away.  But if we stay,  we either get  killed by  the 
{wVectorian  guards that try to  regain the temple, or the men  will end up  killing 
{weach other,  starting with me, who,  in their eyes, caused  this trouble. Ah well,

{wI am writing this hidden in a small room, my ribs broken and bleeding from a wound 
{win my head. Apparently Zorial stirred up the men to vent their anger on me. Polak 
{wwarned me that they were talking about backstabbing me in my sleep. So a small 
{wgroup of loyal men, Polak and I tried to flee out of the temple. That traitor 
{wZoliar noticed us and shouted for help. We had to turn around and flee deeper into 
{wthe catacombs of the temple. A cowardly act some might say, but I do not believe

{w
{wWe were followed and decided to wait for them. We no longer had any hope we could 
{wleave the temple without fighting.  Our followers were with more,  but we had the 
{wadvantage  that we were able to quickly make an ambush. I dont feel like telling 
{wmuch about what happened. It feels strange to kill people that were once friends, 
{wbut we cannot always choose our own destiny. Both parties got tired, but from our

{wBut suddenly the Behemoths charged at us, coming from their positions outside the 
{wtemple.  They trampled most of our opponents and my men, but huge as they are, it
{wwas  difficult  for them  to attack  us in our  hidden  positions.  With  the two 
{wBehemoths  between us and the  exit, there  didnt seem to be  a single chance we 
{wcould escape.  Polak suddenly yelled for  cover and sprinted  to Zorial.  Totally 
{wdazed by this direct attack, Zorial had just enough time to draw his sword before 
{whe was  pierced by Polaks dagger.  Polak ran to the next man,  ready to kill, but 
{wnow  Zorial  was dead,  the Behemoths  were no  longer charmed.  The  battlefield 
{wdissolved into complete chaos  as the Behemoths trampled and crushed everybody in 
{wtheir way. Everybody was killed except me.  Maybe I should have attacked the two, 
{wbut  what would  it have  mattered?  I stood there frightened,  hiding  behind  a 
{wpillar.  The two behemoths lost  interest and started  to fight each other. These 
{wcreatures  are the most  terrible beasts I have ever seen.  Their force is not in 
{wproportion  to their weight, so  each blow made  the other fly through  the room. 
{wScared  they would  notice me, I decided to  go deeper into the  catacombs.  Tart 
{wdetail is that  I found a  few beautiful  boots which  belonged to  Monzuka and a 
{wmagical light there, both probably worth enough to buy me a house and other stuff 
{wI would need to start over with my life. Now it is too late. It was my own fault.

The two  hallways meet each  other here  
in this  larger room.  Decorations that  
must have been  overwhelming when  they  
were created, are now covered with dust 
and corroded by the high humidity here. 
The quality of  the materials must have 
been  not as  good as  that of  mitril.    
Still it  is obvious  that the builders  
or  the principals of  this temple must  
have  been  extemely  wealthy  persons.{x

to the west it leads back to the marble path. Now you are
close to the temple it seems that unlike it appeared from 
afar it is only lightly damaged. The large pieces of debris 
that lie shattered all over the roof came from the temple
south. Obviously this one is no longer used either, since

This  looks  like  the  place where the

were led,  back in the days this temple

in  the center, close  to the  southern 
wall.  Behind the  altar  a very  small 
stairway leads down,  below the temple. 
Nothing but darkness can be seen there,
it was probably used by the priest that
was leading  the  ceremony. North leads 
back to the hallways of the temple. The 
walls  here are decorated  with  mitril 
symbols,  that kept  their  beauty over
