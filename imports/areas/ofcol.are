A large street heads from the western part of the old City to the

of grass growing from inbetween.  On either side stood the sides of
the western city buildings, their ruins now decaying under the natural
process.  The air is still.

charred from a massive fire, gutted and decaying.  Grass grows from

A large gated wall stands 10 feet above the ground, the forest to

covering a good portion of it.  The gates stand open, one hanging off
its hinges.  Made of iron they are slowly rusting away.  Inside the
sites of an old city stand, grass and nature growing wild.  Carved in
the stone frame of the gate reads "Ofcol".

underground at one time.  The place is totally shook up, and messy. 
You see a bookshelf filled with old books, and antique furniture. 
There is boxes stacked up against the door to the west, which looks to
go to another room.  This room looks to be the only one used in a long
time, the rest of the house is blocked off.
