Rise, and be not afraid.  I have no need to be feared. I am more 
of a goddess than that. Look upon me, and know Magic.  I am 
Mystra.  Priests may prattle of this god or that, but over what 
mortals of Toril call "magic"-because they understand it not-
there is no other. I am the Weaver, the Road Ascending, the 
One True Way. Terrible I must be, all too often, and the mortals 
whom I so love-for I was one of you, not so long ago-often cry 
out at me, or entreat me to work magic for them, or unfold all 
its mysteries to them at once, like a child who desires all that is 
good to eat to appear upon his platter in an instant.  And if I 
gave the mysteries that are mine to nurture and keep, unfolded 
and bright in all their myriad glory, who among mortals could 
behold them and remain sane?  Aye, think on that, and for the 
love I bear you and all your kind, leave off cowering. I smite or 
give aid as I see needful, not in whatever wise trembling 
supplicants-or those who threaten-desire to move me.  When you 
feel lonely, or lost, and think dark magics raised against you, 
remember this moment. Feel the weight of my power, as it flows-
not turned against you, but so vast that it could sweep you away, 
cries unheard, in an effortless instant. My power, bent upon you 
as I regard you now . . . and touched and awed by it, you yet live. 
I am always here, all about you. You are never truly alone. I flow 
wherever life flows, wherever winds blow and water runs and the 
sun and moon chase each other, for there is magic in all things.

page3~
I watch over all who work with the Weave, or meddle 
in its workings. I watch most those who fascinate me with their 
daring, their accomplishments, their characters . . . or their love. 
I watch these seven often, almost as much as the old rogue who kept 
my predecessor's power in the time of her passing, and gave it so 
willingly to me. She lives on in him, and in me. She lives on more 
splendidly still in those who could be termed her daughters: the 
seven mortal women who share a sex, silver hair, beauty, and wits. 
They have outlived most mortals, and still enter each day with gusto, 
a constant delight to me. My only disappointment is that they do not 
work together more often. Yet once in a passing while-in particular, 
when I nudge them ever so gently from behind all the curtains of 
concealment I can spin-they do . . . and I love to watch them at work. 
Watch them with me now.  Aye, my eyes shine. When I was a mortal, 
I wish I'd lived as these magnificent ladies of mine do. I am Mystra, 
and to you all I give this gift . . . the Seven Shining of my Chosen. 
Aye, I weep; whatever you may think, mortal, it is a gift given with love.
~
E
page2~
I deem these rare few, if they will serve me, my Chosen. And 
They are rare. Mortals are so easily bent to willfulness by 
power, so easily broken into tools I can no longer use, for I work 
with love, and must be served willingly, by those who love me. I 
shall not compel service, ever. I will not become what my 
predecessor did, in the despair of her long waiting. I shall give 
with love, and never cease in my giving. The power I oversee, 
because of its might, is a danger to mortals, to gods, and to Toril. 
All three may be blighted or ruined if the Weave is torn or misused 
enough. I stand against that. I am the Guardian of the Weave, and 
its lover. Those who serve me must be the very best of mortals, so 
that they blunder little, and love the Weave as much as I do, coming to understand it as best they can-and far better than others. Chosen do 
my work best when they feel my hand but lightly; when they feel 
free to move and act as mortals do, finding their own vision of the 
Weave, and serving me in their own ways. Chosen are not easy to 
find. Chosen are so special that I have managed to keep no more 
than a bare two handfuls of those my predecessor raised to their 
station. The greatest work of my predecessor-the Mystra who was 
not once a mortal who took the name "Midnight"-was the birthing 
of Chosen she could not find, and so had to make. I speak of the 
Seven Sisters, born under Mystra's hand, to be the sort of mortals
she needed, and that I need even more these days. Mortals are 
wondrous, complex things; my own power is not yet risen enough 
that I dare attempt to make or bear Chosen as she did . . . wherefore 
I look endlessly about Toril, seeking fitting mortals who have arisen 
on their own. 
~
E
page1~
This vast, ever-changing, living Weave is a tapestry of power 
beyond the minds of mortals, though with each passing year 
my work gives me back bright payment, and those who work 
magic can do a little more, and see a little more. Yet those 
who can see and work with much more than most are rarely
sane. The power burns them, twists them, and makes all that 
is flawed and mean greater. Wherefore we have cruel tyrants, 
liches walking beyond death who desire to destroy or use all 
that lives, and wild-eyed dreamers who think that to reshape 
all Toril to their own visions is to master it. We have lands of 
mages who destroy or ruin more than they ever raise up; we 
have doom and devastation, and lives wasted or shattered. 
Mortals know the pain of such darkness, but I share it. I have 
the work of banishing the gloom and seeking to temper the 
blades that are mortal souls so that each time they can take 
a little more, do a little more, see a little more. 
In this work, my hands are manyfold, thanks to the few mortals 
who can see and work with more Art, and remain sane-or, as 
some of them have put it, "sane enough."

    By this time, the deforestation of the Chondalwood is in full swing. The city of Shamph is established along 
    the Emerald Corridor, a road stretching from Shamph to Arrabar. 
143 
    Lumberjacks in the Chondalwood are halted by a large force of elves. Lord Anthony Illistine creates an 
    alliance of the free cities of the region. 
144 
    Battle of Elven Tears. The alliance of free cities in Chondath attacks the elves. Ariel- Than, an elven city, 
    is burned to the ground, and more than 2,000 elves die in the war. The survivors reportedly flee deeper into 
    the wood to the city of Rucien-Xan, a mythical elven home. 
    Six months after the Battle of Elven Tears, Lord Anthony Illistine is named governer of Chondath, and the 
    city-states are finally united under one leader. 
145 
    Dempster Turmish continues his campaign to conquer the Vilhon area. Hlondeth is beseiged. Alaghonian 
    forces are unable to mount an effective seige without closing off access to the Vilhon, and after six months 
    Dempster ends the seige. 
146 
    Lord Dempster attempts a second seige of Hlondeth, but is again defeated, this time by the city's high walls 
    and a powerful barrage of magic. 
150 
    Lord Dempster rebuilds his army for a third attempt at Hlondeth, but dies in his sleep before it is ready. His 
    wife, Florentine, becomes ruler and immediately calls off the attack. 
154 
    Lady Florentine of Turmish is assassinated, setting off endless rounds of political maneuvering by various 
    merchant houses. This 100-year gap in leadership becomes known as the Calmwaters, and the region 
flourishes.

As you suddenly appear upon the isle of Mystra's dance you kiss the
sandy earth as you are finally glad to be away from the ocean, that had
flooded your ship. You wonder how you suddenly got here from where you
sank... you had been miles from any land... Well, anyways, you see miles
of palm trees waving the wind and beautiful shells adorning the beach...
though the shell are all in the shape of what seem to be nine stars...

The Four Mandates of the Hidden Lady
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
1. Thou art a   follower of Mystran, thy way is sacred and ye are 
the favored of the lady. Trust her for she is the everguiding force. Do nae 
defy the word of thy lady for judgement will be cast down upon those who 
would forsake  the faith of the Mother of all Magi.
2. As ye are a follower of the true Art, ye can be good, evil, or neutral, but 
the ways of the church are forever neutral. We will not take sides on matters 
of rivalry (PK), if ye choose to align thyself with a friend ye may, but the
church will not support thee.
3.)As a  follower of Mystra thy fellow Mystran is thy brother or sister. Your
art is your most precious gift. If any are in trouble from those who would 
persecute them, ye are obligated to help them in they time of need.
4.) Your faith does not have to be a all controlling factor of thy life. Mystra
is happy with just a simple prayer after a successful spell. But be forworned
the gift of the Hidden Lady is the most sacred and important thing in thy life
Abuse it and ye will bring down the wrath of thy lady upon thee. (Dont pk
anyone with a just cause. Simply getting eq is NOT a just cause. Revenge 
can be taken if someone pked you, but do not let it consume you, as a 
Mystran you have more things to think about then a petty pker. Always go 
into a fight with a rp purpose. If you go into a  fight for no reason you will 
be taken to the high tribunal and be judged if you are fit to stay as a Mystra)
 
 
And these are the four laws of the Mystran faith, while small in number 
they are strict and hard to follow. Keep faith, my magi.

The only clear path in this forest you notice how the
bricks seem to change colors from blue to white in an almost
chessboard-like design. The rest of this place is misty, the
fogs from the streams and rivers making it almost impossible
to see further than your nose. The sounds of wildlife that you
have never heard before fill the air, the only distinct sound
you can identify is that of a displacer beast...
Looking south, you can make out a pool that seems to be
bubbling with fresh and warm water.

glow of something blue and white on the flat ground.

Entering into a clearing in the forest of mysteries, you
suddenly notice that beneath you is a gigantic glowing pentagram.
The sense of great magicks and summons already fill in your mind.
The pentagram is constantly moving on the ground turning from blue
to white, from white to blue. But as you move your eyes from the ground
to the rest of the setting your jaw suddenly drops. Before you is a huge
gigantic castle made of diamonds, crystals, and almost every imaginable
mineral from the earth stands before you. An entire population of Chultan
fire ants inhabit the castle, only for some reason these ants... are
differant... smart...

The only clear path in this forest you notice how the bricks seem
to change colors from blue to white in an almost chessboard-like
design.  The rest of this place is misty, the fogs from the streams
and rivers making it almost impossible to see further than your nose. 
The sounds of wildlife that you have never heard before fill the air,
the only distinct sound you can identify is that of a displacer
beast...  Looking south, you can make out a pool that seems to be
bubbling with fresh and warm water.

You suddenly enter into a realm that seems to be
incredibly differant from the rest of the forest
of mysteries... Everything here glows with awesome
power, power that could only be created by some immortal
force. A gurgling spring flows continously in the
center of the clearing and to the side a chipped altar
sits imbedded in the damp ground. Next to the spring a
small fire is being tended by an ancient woman, her hair
blue and white. Even the vines seem to be placed perfectly
here, interwining and twisting to form walls against
the wild of the forest.
