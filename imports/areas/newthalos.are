This mob is a special mob set here by Dugmaren.  It is invisible to
mortals under normal circumstances, which makes it all the more
interesting...  
{x
You see Dugmaren likes to watch all the fun wiznet output, such as
player deaths (oh no!) and levels (go newbies!!!) and people he knows
connecting (--> SomeoneYouKnow@gibberishsocket.com has connected.).
{x
What Dugmaren doesn't like to eat or see is spam :(
More often than not, the spam that Dugmaren does see goes something
like this:
{x
{Y-->{x Spam spam spam LazyMortal spam spam spam spam spam!
{Y-->{x East
{x
So, that's what i'm here for.  Any players going east when i'm in
the room...well, I force them to do a look, which will break the
spam cycle, if only for a little bit...yay

Dancing Daemon Inn~
~
A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon. An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis. The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage. The large booths along the
wall are filled with people drinking and having a grand time. You feel like
partying here.
The only obvious exit is to the north.

those known only to the New Thalos market, barrage your senses. The only
hope of making any sense of what's going on here is to wander around. The
Market continues north, west, and east, with the Medina trailing off south.

tower over you. It's easy to understand why they hangout here once you
notice the weapon shop and the armory close by. Perhaps you might stop

Southwestern Market Square~

This area of market square seems relatively quiet, save the
high-pitched banter of the shopkeepers attempting to lure people into
their stores.  A general store is to the west, while south is a small
store named Ahkeem's, who is known in this town for making items
suited for any adventurer or person looking to wear the latest in
fashion.  The market's sprawl continues east and north of here.

the northern end.  West Main Street begins here and heads for the
gate. The market's expanse fills the other directions.

Port Walk~
~
This new walk that now stands where Guild Street once stood now
houses the New Thalos airship port, which rises high above the
rooftops of the city.  The port is accentuated with many interwoven
beams of lumber--a material that is plentiful in these parts.  And
thanks to the builder's efforts, much of the unsightly forests to the
north have since been clear cutted, bringing a clear view to pilots
who search for the city of New Thalos.  Port Walk continues up the
ramp here into the port complex, and intersects East Main Street to
the south.

deep red carpeting underfoot shows not a speck of wear or dirt. It's obvious

Entrance to the Guild of Clerics~
~
This hall pales in comparison to that of the main hall, but is beautiful
in its own right. Shaven heads and brown robes can be seen milling about
quitely talking to each other. North is back inside the temple proper,
and south is the entrance to the cleric's bar.

Saska's Library~

Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.

The river flows out from the city down a long winding gully towards
the Sea of Dragons. To the south of you lies the great eastern desert
and north a wide open expanse of grass. You can just barely make out
a road that seems to be traveling alongside the river but the banks are
too steep for you to see very far.

The north wall of New Thalos follows along the Casbah.  To the

flowing Ishtar River to the south.  The Casbah continues east and

the murmur of several rangers conversing silently among themselves you pick
out some conversation topics like the local boom in the wolf population and
how it is a result of the overpopulation of rabbits.

A small room off to the side of the library has been built to hold
the rare book collection of the Ranger's Guild.  The shelves, though
newly installed, look to be very old, and have already gathered a
thick layer of dust and cobwebs.  A beam of light falls to the floor
here from a skylight.  A long chain dangles down from it, and the
skylight remains slightly open...

less a roof than a small, fenced in section of alley.  As the hunting
lodge and library were both built below the level of the city streets,
this area lies slightly above them, with a small jump to the west
leading back down to a dark alley.  The sounds of the nearby market
square can be heard here, though this place remains relatively quiet
and free from intrusion.

The river of Westbridge blows now between two walls on either side
making up its shore.  Above is the city of Westbridge as the river
passes the three bridges connecting the northern city with the
southern half.  On either side wooden docks line the river walls,
built for the parking of airships in the area.

the atrium and guild house were built below the level of the city,
this area atop them lies just a few paces above the st Building walls
surround it in all directions save west, where there is a dark alley.

gain a high vantage to the nearby lands: the looming mountains of the

blinding yellow sands.  To the north, the private hangar section

of imports and exports. To one side of the shelf a large map

a map of the area (New Thalos to Westbridge) hangs. Around the
room there are pictures of ships, and other harbors.

The new airship port complex brings the new to New Thalos.  It is
massive compared to the modest buildings which lie scattered below. 
The platform is wide, fashioned from thick timbers and covered in a
waxxed canvas tenting.  Wide cables stretch the canvas about and they
whine from the tension that is upon them.  Port Walk continues south
from here, and north it descends down to the city level to intersect
with the Casbah to the north.

for many signifies times of change, and to some it is disliked and
seen as a threat to their way of life.

Dancing Daemon Inn.  The inn looks small and ordinary, save the
patrons which sit at the windows.  Some watch quietly the bustle of
the market square, while others literally hang from them, enjoying
their merryment.  Sultan's Walk is to the west while the doorway to
the inn awaits to the east.

blue and sound as thundering horses across a path of stones.  This
rocky cliff has stood the impending waters for ages, as they have
carved the shores beneath.  Leaning tall and ancient over the shores
is an old tree, scarred and gnarled with what appears to be lightning
damage.

A Boarding Plank~
~
This boarding plank allows one to walk from the dock onto the
nearby ship, which is tall and sleek and modern in appearance.  There
are no sails present, but rather two strange cylindrical devices are
strapped to either side, presumably for propulsion.  More curious is
the lack of any identifying marks on the ship, which would otherwise
suggest what agency built it.

this vantage, the vast stretch of the Sea of Swords can be seen far to
the east--blue as far as the eye can see.  North steps onto the ship.

complete, though right now it is too dangerous to check out.  The only
way off now is via magic or a word of recall.

Entrance to the Guild of Monks~
~
Quiet and sparsely decorated, the small building here is open to
the Sultan's Walk, separated only by an archway.  There is a
stairwell to the left which leads upward to a second level, closed
off by a thick oak door stained with a dark resin.

Large Dojo Room~
~
This room is lined with bamboo rugs and straw mats, while
along the walls are differing lengths of staves.  The entire
room is filled with the scent of incense, though not heavily
so in order to keep the breathing of the Monks clear.  The
smell of sweat hangs in the air, and to the east is a door
that leads to the guildmaster's private meditation chambers.

Monk's Meditation Room~
~
This room is only four white walls and a polished wooden floor.
A small altar with burning candles and incense sits to the
north, while an opaque window looks out over the Sultan's
walk to the west.  A large cushion sits in the center of the
room, upon which sits the Guildmaster when he is meeting
members of his guild.
