You stand within the walls of a large compound.  The walls here seem
thick and uninviting.  Up ahead you see a guard's post.  Behind you are the
iron gates to the small mining town.  And then, the exit north into the

people sit at them, writing out forms and making documents.  Blueprints and
other things lay on tables that sit in the middle of the room.  To the far

The center of the boiler room.  You see large pipes that run to a large
whole in the ceiling.  From there the steam is let loose and floats up to
whatever is about.  People walk past you as the tend to the boilers.  You
see a ladder leading down to some room, a redish glow leaks from within.

Six massive tanks stand here, all with pressure gauges at the
bottoms.  Large pipes run in along the ceiling from the southern wall,
feeding into these tanks.  A hissing sound fills the room and almost
the creak of the iron plated tanks.  From the sides of the tanks run
another set of pipes feeding into one massive one, which goes into the
northern rock wall.  A large valve wheel sits at the junction of all
the pipes.

Large tanks of explosive fuel sit in the eastern wall, large holes
carved into the stone wall hold the makou oil, the fuel used in
airships.  Hoses run off each tank, and hang on the wall.  A metal

Carved into the side of the hollow dead volcano a small accessories
shop for airships stands here.  The inside of this area smells of oil
fumes and other chemicals.  All around you is dirt and grease, and a
large counter sits to the west.  Behind the counter dimly lit hallways
of shelves stand, filled with dusty boxes and other airship parts. 
The sounds of machines echo from behind the shelves, as someone does a
little engine work.  A few old chairs sit in the room, to rest while
your airship is being repaired.  Welcome to the Makou City Airship
Repair Shop.

A large cavern opens up before you, the rock walls itself carved
out to hold the cargo crates and boxes.  Workers walk all around
moving cargo back and forth from different areas, and carring crates
off.  Right as you step in a large desk stands in front of you, and a
dwarf sitting behind it.

Inside this room cut from the volcano rock stands a giant iron
cylinder sitting on its side.  At one end a large shaft slowly pulls
out and pushes back in, driving by an iron arm connected to a large
geared wheel.  Above the geared wheel is another gear, smaller,
connected to a large shaft running into the eastern wall.  A small
flow of water trickles out from underneath the shaft.  A large pipe
runs in from the southern wall and connects underneath the iron
cylinder.  A second pipe running from the top disappears into the
northern wall.  Only a small light comes from an orb hanging from the
ceiling.
