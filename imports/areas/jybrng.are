Ivy is the Joybringer's master gardener, spending most of her time
in maintenance of the fabulous grounds around the manor.  When she is
not outdoors gardening, she is working on her potions, or relaxing in
the conservatory.  All Ivy's potions are made from plant extracts
taken from plants grown directly on the manor grounds.

Lord Hellebore is a sturdy man, accustomed to hard work outdoors. 
He is the stablemaster for the Joybringers, as was his father before
him, and he prides himself in the quality of the horses that come out
of his stables.  Hellebore's Dapple Greys are the finest in the
realms.

Lady Acanthus is a striking woman.  Although she is small, her
exceptionally fine features hint at some fey heritage.  Perhaps this
explains her afinity for both these delicate plants and the tiny birds
around which she thrives.

Lord Foxglove is a handsome man, but all accounts.  He is
impeccably dressed, with not a speck of dirt, or blood for that
matter, upon him.  While handsome, he is not a warm or friendly man,
and the only time he has been seen to smile is when his {Ci{wc{Cy b{wl{cu{Ce{x eyes
stare into yours as he {Rs{rlits your throat.  {x

Lord Aster is a well reputed jewler throughout the realms.  He is
middle-aged with salt and pepper hair, and a hawklike nose.  A pair of
half-moon spectacles perch upon his nose giving him the appearance of
looking down at his clients at all times.  Haing retired several years
ago, most of the jewelry in his shop is crafted elsewhere in the
realms.

Lord Snapdragon is the blacksmith for the Joybringers.  Enjoying
his solitude, he remains outside the manor, prefering to stay in the
woods at the edge of the property.  Lord Snapdragon is the veteran of
many battles, but as he reached middle age, he retired from the
soldiering life, chosing instead to contribute to battles by forging
beautiful implements for the next generation to wield and wear into
battle.

are the exclusive mounts for the Joybringers.  Their sleek coats and
exquisite markings make these horses desireable for that alone, but
when coupled with their fine bones and fleet feet, these horses are
prime examples of what every horse should be.

out from every step.  The west lawn leads around the west side of the
manor, with a Boxwood Maze located to the down.  The Terrace of

have been augmented by magic, and the doors shift randomly in time. 
The manor house remains to the east, with no apparent exit to that

woods north of the manor.  Oak and Maple trees dominate the landscape.

from a fire and a pipe.  {x

The Blacksmith's Shop~

{8The blacksmith's shop is a pair of small buildings, the shop itself
and the waterwheel located just to the east.  The shop is of simple
wood construction with exposed beams and tools of the trade hanging on
all the walls.  A Large bellows is built into the eastern side of the
shop, and appears to be mechanically driven.  The Forge itself is a
huge affair dominating the north wall.  Anvils of differing sizes are
spread in a semicircle around the forge.  {x
