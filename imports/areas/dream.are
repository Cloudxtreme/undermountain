Road to Newfane~

You are on a gently curving north-south road.  On your east side a youthful
river sparkles blue and rushes in the sunlight.  On the west, green leaves and
green ferns burst against the rich brown earth.  You feel the heat of your
healthy muscles as you travel swiftly down the well-paved road.

white cotton and wearing colorful hats and bells.

floor.  You see three long lines of dancers, alternating men and women, in
some sort of progressive country dance.  Two fiddlers, a flautist, and a
harpsichord player provide the music.  You hear scattered screams of joy
from the dancers.

people in the hall chasing one poor man who is yelling at the top of
his lungs.  Wait a minute.  These people are all holding hands and smiling!
The man in front is leading them in a spiral!  They're DANCING!  And you
thought people didn't dance like this any more!
