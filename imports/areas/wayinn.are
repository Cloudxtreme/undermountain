smithy blacksmith meten~
Meten the Blacksmith~
Meten the Blacksmith is here.
~
Meten is a large fellow, with wide shoulders and bulging muscles. 
He wears a rather small apron for his size, but the apron is normal. 
It is he that is large.  He wields a simple smithing hammer and works
his metal on a simple tempered iron anvil.  Several of his pieces lie
about.  Few of them are of weapons and armor.  Strangely enough,
nearly all of his creations are decorative fixtures, yokes, and
fastens.

A small boy~
A small boy stand by the tables, selling things for the blacksmith.
~
The boy is young, his face is black with soot and beneath it he
smiles.  He seems to like his job as the blacksmith's servant, or as
he would call it, his apprentice.  He wears a small leather belt from
which hangs mini smithing tools of his own: a hammer, working iron,
and several furnace spikes.  A loose fitting tunic covers him, also
tattered and covered in soot.

{WG{8e{wn{8l{wy{x the {WW{8eaponsmith{x stands here hammering on a piece.
~
He is tall and sweaty--a human most likely from the upper lands as
evident by his full beard and weathered skin.  He drives the hammer
down as if it were a bundle of straw.  He barely grits at the resonant
clash of metal upon metal.  His overalls are burned and torn, but they
fit him like a glove, from many years of use.

Magic Shop~
~
A musty odor wafts about the bookshelves that reach to the top of
the low ceiling.  Each shelf is overflowing with ancient tomes and
texts, and everything is covered in a thick layer of dust.  A few old
wooden tables are lined up, blocking access to the rear bookshelves,
and are piled high with a wide assortment of books, vials, cauldrons,
and other magical trinkets.  The overcrowded room is lighted by a
single lantern, although it strangely gives off more light than it
should...

This building is sparse, as far as smithy's go.  There is a large
furnace at the back that stretches near across the room.  On one end,
a giant bellows fans the furnace, while on the other, two firepits
keep tools and bar stock red hot for working.  At the center sits
three anvils, two massive iron monstrosities and one smaller anvil for
finer work.  Many tools hang against the far left wall, and on the far
right hang shelves and various finished and half finished works.  The
smithy stands at the center of the room, working a piece of metal.

small fixture objects, which is strange for a blacksmith of these
parts to be making since demand for weapons and armor is very high in
the realms.  A young boy stands nearby the items, peddling a sale for

It is black from many years of use.  There is one wall to the back of
the open shed where hangs many more of the blacksmith's pieces.  A
couple of chairs sit just in front of it with a small table nearby
where playing cards are scattered.  At the center of the open shed is
the anvil, set high off the ground for the tall blacksmith to work
upon while standing.  The blacksmith stands directly behind it, wiping
his hands upon his apron as he studies a piece of metal upon his
anvil.

You enter a long hallway, leading east and west.  A sign indicates
the Way Inn's Guest Rooms, and shows the Rooms 1-4 lie to the west,
and rooms 5-8 lie to the east.  Torches line the whitewashed walls and

Large blocks of ice sit sporadically on the floor, chilling this
room considerably.  All assortments of meat hang from large hooks in
the ceiling.  Sausage, beef, and strange, unrecognizable cuts hang,
glazed over with ice.  Wooden crates on the floor hold more meat
still, of all shapes, sizes, colors and varieties.  The only exit is
south, to the Pantry.

of bread, muffins, bagels, and many different pastries wait to be
devoured.  On the floor, bags of flour and sugar sit patiently,
