IQ Runmaker
~
This is a mob to flag the Claim System as an IQ event.
This mob will not open, change, or otherwise do anything for you or the runs
except mark the Claim Board as an IQ.

"mpstat iq maker" to see the say triggers to flag the runs.

Keep in mind, I would open the run with runpurger first, then load up your IQ event
and then come back here and flag it.

her pristine face.  Long dark hair flows down her back in gentle waves
over her pink dyed blouse.  She wears tight fitting leather pants and
a pair of nicely oiled leather shoes.  A set of daggers stick out from
sheathes attached to her ornately decorated leather belt.

runpurger purger~
runpurger~
Runpurger
~
{C
Runpurger is a mob holding rather complicated mprogs related to the systematic
opening, closing and resetting of Waterdeep's adventure run areas.  The basic
premise of the mprogs is as follows:
{W
Mprog Sequence Starts (MUD Crashes/reboots or runpurger is loaded up)
  1. Countdown mprog does initial check
     - closes all runs
  2. Countdown mprog cycles through base 32 checks
     One run is selected to be opened
     Run is open at next check
  3. Countdown mprog resets/recycles another base 32 checks
     Another run is selected to be opened, regardless if previous runs are done.
  4. Countdown cycles through the opening of every run
     The system resets itself by closing all runs and restarting the countdown.
{C
It is quite common for the mprogs to get "stuck" whereby it no longer counts
down.  This is evident by the lack of any new "run counter" items in runpurger's
inventory (the same items will remain there for a long period of time).  Consult
posted instructions for information on kickstarting the system or utilizing any
of the other features (opening of individual runs, purging of all runs, stopping
any single run from opening).

{^The Prophet tells you {5'I had a vision last night, i saw the
four swords of Ragnarok, the Element Swords. First i saw
a vision of William, holding a flaming sword. The Second
vision I saw was Veiros, carring the sword of the wind.
The Third vision was of a pixie by the name of Sandra,
carring the Sword Of Water. These swords when put together
in the Temple Of Light, will create a powerful blast of
energy, destroying Ragnarok...But the fourth sword is a
mystery to me...When i had a vision of this sword, I was
in total darkness, and a voice gave me a weird riddle...
"Where the sun never shines, where humans never go, a place
of total darkness, and dark creatures, is where the sword
of the Earth lies, guarded by your nightmares." I do not
know what this means, do you?'{x

set aside several items of usefulness for just such an occupation, and
he would add, at a very reasonable price.

THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, before the dawn of man as we knew him,
there was Sir Santa of Claus, an ape-like creature making crude and
pointless toys out of dinobones and his own waste, hurling them at
chimp-like creatures with crinkled hands regardless of how they
behaved the previous year.  These so-called "toys" were buried as
witches, and defecated upon, and hurled at predators when wakened by
the searing grunts of children.  It wasn't a holly jolly Christmas
that year.  For many were killed.  A war-like race of elves from the
Red Planet landed on the ice-encased Earth, and they were immediately
enslaved by the unevolved Santa Ape to make his confused toys using
galactic elfin technology.  Toys were made into recognizable shapes
and given names like "train," but these toys were also thrown at
predators and defecated upon because they were so stupid.  Christmas
still sucked, in a big way.

Meatwad: Boy, this IS a long story. Maybe I WILL get something to eat.

Carl: Yeah, I think I'm gonna get drunk while I listen.

Frylock: So, about this blood...

Robot: Let's just wait for them. ...So you been in the neighborhood long, or...

Frylock: Well, I mean we moved here, next to Carl--

Robot: THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO the ice had made the globe invariable.
Santa Ape did not know where the North Pole was. How could he? He was
born before science existed. So he arbitrarily placed his workshop
RIGHT HERE, long before they unionized, and Christmas was celebrated
at each full Moon in front of a great red ape--

cross bean~
Bean's twisted and bloated corpse hangs from a cross, lifeless.  His
face is painted like a clown, and his privates have been removed with
something that apparently looked red hot.  Bean has a pboard history of
luring NPK players into dangerous situations, despite the NPK players
falling for his tricks, the staff of Waterdeep does not like Bean's ways
of trying to bend the rules.  So thus, fuck you Bean, your character is GONE.
Breath another fucking pboard onto any other character, and you will be banned.

This large cross contains a burnt, twisted corpse that was once
Palladin, an adventure of the Realms who went insane and crusaded
against the deity establishment.  He claimed that the lords aboved
were treading on his freedoms of speech and treating him very
unfairly, not knowing that once you go insane and create angry with
the gods, those privalaged rights disappear.  His existance became
undesired by the deities, and so he was nailed to a cross and burned.

Palladin & Alts were removed from the game, and his socket was banned.

Fawnlily was nailed to this cross for pissing off the immortal staff
in general, majorly Yuna & Nisstyre.  She was given a chance to come
back, until she called Nisstyre & Yuna a liar, and said they lied
alot, all because her site was not unbanned, even though NO ONE SAID
anything about lifting the ban.  May she hang here for life, and never
returned.  May one day she gets the story straight, and stops judging
people without knowing them.

for the past three years is about to give independence to all older

factions made up by the members of such guilds like the Church of Strife
or the Church of Destruction will gain control of their city.  People
are afraid they might have to move away from their family home just
because the new faction is evil.
Kythorn (June).  Each Faction must send into the Tripower (post a
note to Nisstyre) the names of five members in the faction, the

Factions will be voted into these areas by the people.  More news to

riddle~
If ye wish to get to where stone crawls under the great sands,
You must find where people thrive in tents, and travel from day
to day, from the entrance of this place, you must go south towards
the sea, west towards the undergound river, north towards the cities
and south again to the sea. When you go north again, you will be on
the doorsteps.

location, so the castle is hard to find, there is a {^riddle{x on this map, it
may solve the mystery on how to get to the castle.

Welcome to the First National Bank of the Tri-Power State.  To either
side of the room, the walls are lined with guards armed to the teeth.
There are several tellers behind a large wall, protected by iron bars.
The Bank was once powered by Westbridge itself, but now rules under the
government.  Tables line the walls for people to write on.  There are
exits to the west and east.

Beltaine's Chapel of Danu~
~
An empathic wave of holy might radiates from the chamber.  Within,
rosemary is strung from the ceiling, bunched with assorted herbs.
Tomes of ancient lore litter the floor in an entropic pattern and
wisps of incense soothe all about with the sweet sent of jasmine.
Toward the center of the room, a ward of protection pulses in a
hypnotic rhythm.  Interwoven among the runes, the Dreaming brushes
this part of the world and leaves a feeling of tranquillity compared
to no other.  A silver plaque is mounted by the entrance of the
chapel.

This marks the intersection of two streets: Judge Street running east
and west and Emerald Avenue running north and south.  Several small
residences line both of the streets.  The houses are in various states
of upkeep but most look quite comfortable.

Judge Street continues west here and ends shortly to the east at
Coffin Street.  A few large, run-down buildings line the street on
either side.  It seems this area has been somewhat neglected.

This is the beginning of western Judge Street, just west of the City
Plaza.  North is a vacant lot, closed off from access to the street.
To the south is the side of the newly built city hall, bright and clean
with a modern twist to a traditional look in Westbridge.  Just east of
here is Westbridge City Plaza.

This area is the greener side of Westbridge--better known as the
park walk, which includes the city park, surrounding shops, apartments,
and cafes.  A quaint little cafe sits on the north side of the street
with a sign that reads {RPark Cafe{x.  Judge Street continues through to
the west and further to the City Plaza to the east.

This is the park area of Judge Street.  The walk through the park
lies north, accented by lush green grass and wide, empty lots on
both sides of the road.  South and west of here can be found the
western neighborhoods of Westbridge, better known as the nice part
of town.   Judge Street continues west and east.

Steps of the Church~

A large cathedral stands here, with steps leading up to a pair of
ornate doors.  Organ music can be heard filtering out through the
doors; some upbeat, some eerie.  The scent of both well oiled and
burnt wood is in the air.

This is the inside of a small building.  All around is a large room
with a few scattered tables.  A large counter sits to the left.  To
the unobservant this may appear to be a bar, yet it is a special place.
The crowd within don't bother to look at newcomers, they simply continue
their quiet conversations with their customers, sitting at the tables.
This is the store known as {RT{rri{RP{rower{x {*Bo{Wun{*ty {RHu{rnte{Rrs{x.

The walls of this hall, made completely of marble, tower over even
the tallest man, stretching high into the air.  Massive, smooth marble
pillars line the walls, supporting the ceiling high above.  Between

The Hall of {CG{cl{Co{cr{Cy{x~
~
This is the grand Hall of Glory, the final passage on the way to the
Hall of Judgement.  The hallway is lined with tapestries depicting the
great victories of the Pax Faerunis against the darkness of the realms.
The aura of this hallway is breath taking, radiating with the goodness
and light that makes up all those who are in the Pax and all the powerful
warriors who call themselves Paxians.  A large engraving of a harp is
carved high up on the ceiling.  The seal of the Harpers is here, keeping
the balance of the world.

The Hall of {WJu{ws{*t{wi{Wce{x~
~
Walls made entirely of marble surround the room, with massive
pillars running parallel to the main entrance.  Opposite the door is
the Bar, where the judge is sitting, waiting to hear the cases before
him.  Engraved into the wall behind the bar is a warhammer with a a
scale perched on top of it, this is the holy symbol of Tyr, God of
Justice.  This is the hallway the Paxians use to judge the prisoners,
putting them before one of the Church of Justice for review and a fair
and just trial.

{GA{gn old courtyard is here, just off of the Pax Lounge.  The stones,
of what appear to be ancient rocks, are almost completely covered in
moss, which seems to softly glow green.  The grass in this courtyard
does not appear to grow any taller than the mere inches that it is
already.  It is cool with dew, all day, as if it was magical.  The air
in this courtyard is perfect, crisp and cool, and smelling of flowers
and moss.  The blessings of {YCe{yl{wes{yt{Yia{g is upon this place.  {x

{xThe {YP{Wa{YX{x Lounge~
~
This large room, filled with the chatter of Paxians, radiates with
an aura of power.  This is the resting place of the Guardians of
Westbridge.  Upon the walls hang the banners of the clans of the Pax
Faerunis Alliance.  They hang proudly, side by side, on display for
the world to see.  Scattered around the room are several couches, as
well as some tables and chairs.  And stretched along one wall is a bar,
serving drinks to the Paxians.  To the west, a cool breeze wafts in
from the courtyard.

The underground vault of the bank is as cool and quiet as a crypt. There
are rows upon rows of small compartments for holding the most precious of

Inside the large flying structure you find a large lounge type
area.  A large bar stands at the northern end, with a kitchen behind
it.  Hot food is coming in and out to the small tables spread in the
middle of the floor.  To one side you see a few couches and a healing
area.  More or less it looks like an Airship Roadside Diner.  A small
list of BOUNTIES hang on the western wall.

The Temple of Life~
~
This is the interior of a large white marble temple.  A pipe organ
plays in the background as people sing a hymn of peacefulness.  A
priest up front tells the story of the forces of the realms, be it Life,
the force that gives breath and a heartbeat, and Death, the force that
steals these gifts away.  There is a guard standing watch, keeping the
peace.  To the south is the Temple Square and to the west is the donation
room.  To the east is the {RCity Morgue{x and a newer section of Main Street
heads off to the north.

WESTBRIDGE~
This place stands one of the greatest points in the realms, Market
Square.  Market Square is the center point for the city of Westbridge,
and also known to be the center point of the Western Great Realms.
This area features a huge cobblestone square, crowned with a fountain
and statue in the middle.  Park benches line the outer edges,
allowing people to rest.  The center fountain stands tall, a statue in
the middle of Nisstyre Bloodstoner with water flowing around the base.
Several streets lead off different directions.  Going east and west
from the square is {BWestbridge Way{x, a main route between the
major cities.  To the west can be found the Bounty Hunters Office,
Bakery and other shops.  To the east can be found The Quick-Mart and
General Store.  Going north and south is {BMain Street{x of Westbridge.
{WThe Healing Wound {WInn{x, and {WQuestmasters Office{x is north, the {WPark{x and

Invasion, in which the towns people of Westbridge fought against the
Vectorian Nation, destroying its army at these very walls.  Beyond the
walls the city street ends, and the Northern Plains begin.  The gates
lead to other areas like The Elven Valley, Mount Olympus, Makou City,
and the Ruins of Ofcol.

here in the south central part of Westbridge.  Behind the station

roaming gangs, outlaws and lawlessness.  Two large black doors lead

This is the intersection of Arsenal and River Street.  Arsenal continues
north, against the western wall of the city, and south, by the southwest
part of town better known as the Westbridge Neighborhoods-- "a nice place
to live".  River Street begins to the east, following near the river all
the way to the eastern part of town.  The city wall stops abruptly here
and veers far to the west, shaded slightly different in the stones which
are still rough from fresh cuts.  It appears as if the city was expanded
not too long ago to make room for the growing neighborhood.  To the west
begins the Street of Silences in the neighborhood of Westbridge.

You are in the not very big office of the once great Mayor Drott of Westbridge.
A large burnt and completely destoryed desk is standing in front of an evenly
burnt armchair that looks so uncomfortable that Satan himself would not sit in
it. The walls are black and you see a bed made out of old junk. The story is the
town hall caught fire during the great hall, and Mayor Drott went crazy. After the
re-election he still wandered the street thinking he was mayor.

Kate's Diner~
~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew entice patrons through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
classic musical production blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put customers completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Westbridge River, and a doorway leads down onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
exits out to River Street.
On most days Kate can be found here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival.
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

window landing~
You can see a rickety bridge to your northwest, leading back into
Central Westbridge.  A rustic dock connects the Diner with the Westbridge
River, and a boat or two floats lazily past.  Across the river you can see
the Levee and the Guild of Thieves, but they seem very far away from all
of this...

Melancholy's Maps~
~
When the door to the shop is opened, sudden gusts of wind often
enter the shop, sending scraps of paper flying around the room.
This room is cluttered with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books,
and odd scraps.  A desk with slightly less clutter than the rest of
the shop is near the back wall.  A scroll case full of scrolls is
behind the desk.  A bookcase sits to the right and to the left is a
window overlooking a small garden.  A small door, half hidden by a
stack of books, leads to a room in the back of the shop.

A faint smell of incense lingers in the air within this room.  A soft
bearskin rug lays upon the floor, muffling footsteps.  A simple bed lies
against the far wall.  At the foot of it is a sturdy ironbound chest, most
likely full of Melancholy's trappings from her adventuring days.  On a small
table under a window to the east is a vase with a single white rose.  Other
than that, the room is quite bare.

The Great Stone Bridge Of Westbridge.  The original wooden one was
destroyed by the famous Ragnarok that still lingers somewhere overhead.
While crossing the bridge, it is easy to notice the fine stone work that
makes its construction.  The bridge stretches over the River Of Westbridge,
which flows into various caverns and, rumors tells it, all the way to the
Sands Of Sorrow.  Newly created "Makou Gas Lights" lead across the bridge,
casting a greenish light over the water.  The Crier Square of Westbridge
stands to the north.  A short distance to the south is the great green Park
of Westbridge.
