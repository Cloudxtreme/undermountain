East.  A staircase has been built out of sandstone leading down, and you see
some more stalls down there.  If you attempt to go South you will fall off the

sneak~
Sneak and hide are used on players, not mobs.  DO NOT EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO
WALK INTO AN AGGRESSIVE AREA stealthily.  Use invisibility for this...
~
E
backstab~
Backstab lets you sneak up behind a mob (but not a player) and hit the
really hard in the back with a dagger.  This does a lot of extra damage, and
you should have a much easier time finishing him off.  You need to use a small
dagger-type weapon to do this, a big slashing sword doesn't have the right kind
of point.
   If you are grouped with some warriors, they will tell you that you have to
backstab the mob.  If you do this, the mob will attack only you and they will
take no damage.  You should make them use their skills and RESCUE you.
   Don't use this skill until you are at least GOOD at it.  Otherwise you will
be wasting your first attack with a pitiful backstab attempt...
~
E
steal~
Steal lets you take things from players and mobs without having to fight
them for it.  You won't get any experience points for using this or any other
thieving skill, but you can get money and objects pretty quick.
   To steal money, use STEAL <number> <character>.  To steal an object, use
STEAL <object> <character>.  The object must be in the character's inventory,
not worn.  You want to know what the character has in the inventory to steal,
so you will need to PRACtice PEEK, too.
   I have staked a kobold to the ground.  He has a ROCK in his inventory.  Try
to steal it from him.  When you have gotten the rock, please give the rock
back to the kobold so the other thieves can steal it from him.  Notice that you
can't steal the collar off of him.
~
E
newbie~
Ok, you have made it to the thieves guild.  I will assume that you know how
to do things like PRACtice and talk to the other players, and know to run away
from a fight you can't win.

   The guildmaster here is very good at teaching you the tools of the trade.
However, he is a lot more interested in staying in this room and picking that
big lock than he is in helping you.  He is not going to tell you what to
study or give you hints on how to rob.  If you are having trouble figuring out
what skills to PRACtice, use the CANT command to speak to the other thieves on
line.  They will help you.  (This book also has a few pointers.)

book~
The book is titled 'So You Want to be a Thief', by someone named Slash.

   The book has the following chapters you can LOOK at.  (Don't even think of
nicking this book.)

   Chapter 1:  So you have decided to become a thief  (LOOK NEWBIE)
   Chapter 2:  Stealing, Nicking and Borrowing        (LOOK STEAL)
   Chapter 3:  The Art of surprise                    (LOOK BACKSTAB)
   Chapter 4:  Sneaking around where you don't belong (LOOK SNEAK)

   It looks like someone nicked the rest of the book...

mosaic~
You stare in awe at the aching beauty of a quarter-completed mosaic of a huge

mosaic is a piece of glass colored and cut so perfectly that you feel this is
