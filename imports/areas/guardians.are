Vesper laden stones create the ancient archways which mark the entrance to
the main chamber.  On either side of the portal, granite holders burn
incense with a taunt vaporous stream arcing toward the muraled ceiling. 
Long ceremonial candles line the back wall collecting into a mass array of
candelabras, and chanting is heard in the distance.  Vivid tapestries of
forgotten lore are placed between the stained glass windows, and at the
center of the grand hall lays the Guardian's stone council table.

Crimson Guardians Entrance Room~

Ceiling beams crisscross in a octagonal enigmatic pattern signifying the
triad of Oghma's brethren.  The stone floor mimics the heaven of the
majestic room, but takes on a more mobious relief.  Armored suits line the
wall, and seem to watch with a knowing glance.

Artifacts of the Netheral age are scattered about the room in an orderly
fashion.  Wands, potions, and jewelry are placed behind wards of protection
that pulsate a strong aura.  Toward the center of the enclave is a sunken
pit for common use.  Relics from all over the land can be found within, as
well as a chest of assigned equipment for Guardian members.

~
About a league into the forest, behind the Guardian Stronghold, is a
enclosed grove.  Twisted about, ancient trees stretch up to form a oaken
dome that creates a hallowed sylvan scape.  A minute amount of light
penetrates the canopy to illuminate the standing stones strategically place
in a circular pattern.  Within the archways of the monoliths, air ripples
due to a breach of reality that links to another part of the world.

Flickering soft light illuminates the chamber with a solemn glow, and lanterns
cast a shadowed protector across the walls. On the back of the room the crest 
of the Guardians is displayed, forged from the tears of the Goddess Celestia. 
Exquisitely scrolled chestnut furniture embellishes the atmosphere, while instruments 
from the far reaches of the realms are mounted about the walls.  Vast amounts of 
paperwork are heaped in orderly piles on a desk that identifies the Order's desk.

Maxell - on sitting at the table~
Say Welcome $n.
say Have you come to listen to the history of the Crimson Guardians?
~
#20151
Maxell - On saying Yes~
say Excellent $n!  It is always important to know the roots of your family.
say Where shall we start $n?
say The {Mfirst{m, {Msecond{m, {Mthird{m, or {Mfourth {mgeneration?{x
~
#20152
Maxell - On saying First~
say Unfortunately $n...  Not much is known about the first generation.
say It is said that it was a group of people looking to excape the murderers
say and the crimes of the outside world.
say One thing is agreed upon though.
say We like to think that these "Lost Guardians" held the same ideals
say that have made this the greatest family in the realms.
~
#20153
Maxell - On saying second~
say The second generation we know a little more about.
say The new version of our family was headed by one known as Beltaine,
say and he was shortly joined in leadership by a man named Eclipse.
say The ideals and rules of the family were more lax in those times
say but the majority of the family held those ideals that have grown into
say our backbone to be important.  
say Durring This time in our history This section of the clanhall was built
say and I was enlisted as the family's healer.
say At the end of the second generation the more prominent members of the
say family made the decision to wipe our scrolls clean and begin anew to
say refresh ourselves and remove the names that had not shown their faces
say for some time.
say The members prior to this revolution within the family are unknown.
say All that is known is that many of the names were never seen again
say within these halls.
~
#20154
Maximm - On saying Third~
say The third generation members are listed on one of the tablets over
say there on the wall.
emote points to the tablet labeled "Third Generation"
say Durring this period of the families existence many changes took place.
say Early in this generation Morann was enlisted in helping me keep up with
say our ever growing numbers.  Open hostility was declared against the
say folowers of Cyric.  Our hall was expanded to accomodate our growing numbers
say and gained several new amenities including a resident trader and bard.
say The darker things to happen include the conversion of several Guardians
say to the lord of nightmares and their departure to serve his will.  The
say terrible virus Hemelia struck the realms and caused widespread sickness
say and devestation.  Of course a cure was eventually found and the populace
say recovered, but the world was never the same again.
say At the end of the third generation it was again deemed needed to erase our
say scrolls and begin anew.  This ushered in the fourth age of the Crimson
say Guardians
~
#20155
Maxell - On saying fourth~
say again the members of the fourth generation of the Crimson Guardians are
say listed on one of the tablets on the wall.
emote points to a tablet labeled "Fourth Generation".
say Elminster and Ventor, two leaders from the end of the third generation
say returned again to lead and were joined in leadership by Zane and Taryn.
say We gained a stable for our hall to house our herd of pegasi as well
say as a stable keeper to attend them.  Durring this time one of our own
say was stolen from her home and held captive within the halls of Talos
say the Storm Lord.  She was eventually recovered by a few members of the
say family and returned here to recover from her wounds.
say The clan has not gone through a resetting of the scrolls since the beginning
say of the fourth generation.  And the history of the fifth generation is still
say in the process of discovery and recording.  The sixth generation, your
say generation, is now forging new history for the family and some day in the future
say I will be telling new Guardians of your exploits.  So be strong and continue
say to make this the greatest of all families.
