You are now in the northeastern corner of the {RBattle {wArena{x, and all
around you there are hills where fellow harpers have run to trying to
get some protection as their clan members came after them.  While the
fighting is all in good fun you can see blood from where these harpers
have failed to get the protection they needed in time.  The arena
continues to the west and south.

candelabra positioned by the eastern wall.  On the western wall you
can see a small library.  You pick a book randomly and skip through
its pages to see what it is about.  Inside you find prayers meant to
be sung in the name of {BT{by{Br,{was well as a silver Ankh used to mark an
important page.  You read through that page and realize that it is a
Paladin's death song.  The door open behind you and you feel the
presence of a good being.  Arman smiles at you and inquires: "How may
I help you my child?"

{WYou have entered a large gloomy room and as you look around, you
are met by the gaze of two female statues one portraying Mystra, the
Goddess of Magic the other Selena, wife of the Wizard who this study
belongs to.  The only light in the room is the {Mp{murple{W flames that
surround each of the four statues in the room.  Two at the door
(Mystra and Selena) and one in each of the far corners of the room,
each showing a Drow Warrior.  The only window in the room is located
in the far wall but heavy curtains prevent any light from entering the
room.  In the middle is a large desk littered with books and dusty
tomes though a small area is cleared as a work area.  The only other
objects in the room are huge book shelves filled with tomes and
parchments hiding{BA{brcane{W knowledge and a spiral staircase in the corner
closest to you from which you came.
