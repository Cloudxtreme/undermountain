It is a short figured wrapped in a thick cloak of rags.  In the
darkness, it seems rather sinister, though it makes no sudden moves to
alarm you.  There are trinkets and charms of various kinds around its
neck and arms and ankles, or what you assume to be its ankles and
arms, since they are concealed.  More interesting than the way it
looks is the fact that it can speak.  Hear now what it has to say.

He is a short...  Thing, vaguely transparent, and somewhat pudgy
around the midsection.  By best accounts, he is of the race of espers,
and NO, he DOES NOT serve esper juice.  He has a fine selection of
drinks, at affordable prices, though money is, after all, beyond the
concern of immortals.  Still it is a quaint way of getting something,
for seemingly something, as is the way of mortals.  And to top it all
off, he takes requests (though it may take some time for the airship
traders to get it to this place, after all, it is beyond mortal
realms).

Of all the creatures to put in a cave, a bird seems to be the last
option, but this raven was summoned here nonetheless.  Moon ravens are
a unique species, with dark vision and keen senses, so perhaps these
birds were intended as scouts to protect this place from intruders.

This owl is a natural creature of the night, though not a native to

that's perhaps a great incentive for being in less than hospitable
conditions.

psychadelic love beads~
Bead after bead, strung by the heart
the pulse quickens the breaths thicken,
and love is off to a good start,
I lay a bead on precarious thread
the glimmer slides and mates
I lay another, from my hand it fled
to the other which calmly awaits
The third goes down as the other two did
With a nimble spin and a shrug
And four and five, make the necklace alive
Capped and knotted with a tug
Then begins the task
Finishing touches at last,
But the necklace is already done,
What then you ask,
Is my final task,
Well to give Loven these beads silly one!

The Caves of Mist are perhaps only recognizable by those
versed in ancient legends.  In accordance to the popular
version, a child born of the blood of Khelben Blackstaff
became lost in the forests of Ardeep. She wandered, lost
for over three days before a band of pixies found her in
peril, for a pack of wolves had sent her up a tree where
they waited for her to come down. The pixies carried her
away to Crystabelle Village, where they raised her up as
one of their own.  The second half of the tale goes that
she became a natural summoner of beasts, an adept of the
ways of Mielikki and pure in heart as those of pixiekind.
Much of her life was spent trying to understand her past,
but the civilized men who settled the western coast were
still very much ignorant and cast her out from their own.
In her later years, she became a recluse from all things
including the pixies who loved her, and in her isolation
she summoned fantasic creatures who would make for her a
wonderous home carved from the mountains and within they
all dwelled in peace until her dying days. With her last
tear that fell to the ground, a mist dragon was summoned
and called upon to guard that resting place for eternity.{x

This place of mist is shrouded in legends--legends
so good that it is often difficult to discern the
facts from the myth.  
{8
Of the truth, this place was created from the mind
different that the one who finished it.  It was of
another universe that this place was originally
conceived, in a placed called Final Fantasy that a
girl named Rydia was made.  This was to be her home,
but as sure as the passage of time, things do tend
to change. He turned his back on the place he began.
{8
And many years later, another stepped up to the 
plate and walked his half strung dreams in interest.
But this man had another purpose in mind for this
place, and with permission, began to weave a legend
of his own.  The girl would stay in the story, but
her name would be erased forever.  No creature here
will ever mention her name, as no mention will be

{8
That person who stepped up to the challenge of
finishing this place succeeded, at least in his
own mind, but only the test of time will tell if
his intuition was true.  
{8
He chose to keep four of the original premises of
the area:  The caves, the village, the girl and
the dragon who the girl was linked to.  And with
that beginning, he created an end, which detailed
her lineage of the one known as Blackstaff, her
exile from society, her discovery by pixies, and
her eventual isolation from everything she once
knew.
{8
In many ways, she is the embodiment of he who
created her, for his was a life lived in 
isolation, where in his own world he created
fantastic creatures and a place of wonder to
entertain those who seek adventure, and perhaps
some substance to a multifaced but small world.
{8
And as her story ends with the creatures making
for her a great mausoleum and forever guarding
it from intrusion, so too did her creator hope
his presence in this world would end.

{8
When he has poured his blood and sweat over his
creations, he creates for himself a legacy--one he
hopes no one will soon forget.
{8
And his work is far from over.  Good things to come:
A wonderous hall of mystery, a prophecy of five who
will come to save the world, a fantastic machine that
uses dreams to explore the past, a girl born of the
blood of mist, a family of keepers who will usher in
the next generation as a beacon for all to look upon,
and many things in between that will tie it all
together, for from one mind, many are linked.
{8
But for now, enjoy the Caves of Mist. There are four
items that one who has explored everything should
acquire:
{8
Concealing Mist, A Pendant of Neverhaze, A Buckler
of Mist, and a Circle of Three Beliefs.

She is an aged titan, being the second elder called
upon by the girl to remain in her company and favor.
It is through her guidance that the village owes to

questions that you might have, including why no one
in the village has a name including the lonely girl.{x

You step upon the timbers of a vastly long bridge--a
bridge which connects two seemingly different points
in reality.  To the west swirl the ethereal spindles
of intervention: the cumulative manifestation of the
Weave as it is projected into reality. It appears as
a distorting of reality, which breaks and tears into
many fine threads that first run parallel then begin
to crossand intertwine into a chaotic mix of smeared
images and colors.  To the east the timbers begin to
take form, stretching as a long bridge that does not
sway or bend, and seemingly is without support above
the swirling abyss below.  Far at the eastern end is
a wall overgrown with vegetation, and an opened gate
behind which is a large manor which rises from dense
swirling mist that hazes over all detail at the base.{x

This strange place lies detached from the rest of reality,
connected only by the spindles from which immortal beings
are the only ones who may traverse them. The doorway is a
massive stone arch of traditional dwarven masonry, though
with a touch of elven style, as suggested by the means by
which the edges are broken and notched to coincide with a
single neighboring block of stone. The doorway is made of
hard wood, thick and coated in oil to protect it from the
elements.  It rests on four massive iron hinges and locks
with two mechanisms of gnomish design. The crest of House
Brightmantle is carved upon the keystone, and beneath the
dual torchposts which forever remain burning are crumbled
statues of dragonkind.  An iron ring sits hinged upon the
door as a knocker, though immortals have no need for such.{x

This room is one of the guest rooms, and seems rather
ornate for such a simple purpose, but Lord Azuth does
not wave away his duties as a host in any respect. In
the dim light there is a large canopied bed with four

nearby, including a chest of drawers and a large desk.{x

You enter a massive foyer that spans many paces up where
a skydome shines mystical light from the spindles. Above,
a massive oil burning chandelier hangs and tosses down a
barrage of eerie shadows. Two doorways exit on both ends,
with another large doorway directly ahead, and a doubled
spiral staircase of wood and granite.  The balcony above
is lined with many hanging plants and statues, and seems
to branch off into many different upstairs rooms. A dais
sits at the center, upon which rests a magical open book.{x

{8the walls are perfectly square is the lack {wof stones.

say Of course I laughed.

say Could I build such a helm?  Of course I could.  And I did.
say I held a vigil that night, me and the stranger, my hammer and raw ore.
say And I forged that helm through a fit of unconscious haze.
say I scarcely remember how I made it, only the perfection of its completion.
say And when we inserted the polished Star Rubies, I couldn't help but smile.
say The raised brow that came to a point at the temple, where a single ruby sat.
say The insides lined with soft calfhide and stitched by Aireva herself.
say And the seven chainlinked side flats that hung as the final touch to perfection.
say For seven represented the stranger's doctrine.  His seven guiding principles.
say And he paid me well, but the worth lied in making that helm for him.
say Never shall I make another like it.  It was no less than magic.
