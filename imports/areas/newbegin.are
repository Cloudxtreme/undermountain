He stands no taller than three feet, but Drezfin is a giant

large, and his goatee flames just as brightly.  He is balding,
but unlike many who try to hide it, what remains of Drezfin's 
hair looks as though he put his finger into a socket.  Always
chipper, always excited, Drezfin loves nothing more than 
creating.

which in turn, gives way to an elaborate frieze.  Warriors in full
battle poses, mages shooting lightning from their fingertips, druids
tending a growing vine, vampires pulling life from the neck of a 
victim, clerics administering healing, thieves picking pockets, and
rangers tracking an elusive hart.  Ivy runs up the brick walls of the
building itself, extending almost to the belfry that sits stoically
atop the hall.

Beneath the Entablature~
~
{x
A grand double door sits to the north of the wide portico that
extends beneath the entablature.  Here, one can see just how
grand the columns truly are, and just how high they reach.  A
chandelier on a long chain hangs down to offer light when it is 
dark.  Tall windows stand on each side of the door, their edges
covered over by ivy.

Guild Hall~
~
{x
The beautiful and grand double doors open to a massive great hall
that is domed at the very top and decorated with immaculately
detailed frescoes.  Doors sit to the east and west, carved out of 
beautiful mahogany, each bearing the sigil of their respective class.
A set of spiral stairs leads upward to a balcony where yet another
door waits for adventurers.

Guild Hall~

{x
The massive great hall ends here at three beautifully carved
mahogany doors.  Another spiral staircase winds up to a balcony
where another door sits.  The domed ceiling is covered in a 
beautiful fresco, and every sound seems to echo high into its
arch.  The marbled floors shine and a kiosk sits in the center
of the hall with a map inside.

This street runs east to west and is lined with brick-cobblestones.
Tiny patches of grass try to grow up between the bricks, but end up
dying away as they are trod underfoot repeatedly.  To the south is
the broadside of a shop, while the north is a fenced off vacant lot.
To the east is Lathander Square.

Armor Shop~
~
{x
The shop is small and quite hot with the forge that sits at
the back of the store.  Armor pieces sit on the floor, on the
counter, and hang on the walls.  The ceiling holds various
lengths of cured leather, waiting for a customer to place an
order.

Lathander Street runs toward the north and turns toward
east.  To the west is the weapons shop, while the shop
to the south is practically glowing with the light that
flows from it.  Back to the north is Lathander Square and
a few other shops, east is the bank.

Weapon Shop~
~
{x
This room is littered with metal shavings and stinks of
the singe of metal and tinny scent of sweat.  It is lit
by a myriad of floating fire orbs, which seem to add to 
the sweltering heat that lays over the room like a blanket.
Weapons line the walls from top to bottom, obviously 
available for purchase.

Magic Shop~

{x
This small shop is filled with all kinds of odd smells -
from the sharp and biting, to the rank and vile.  The 
ceiling has scorch marks where other potions have blown 
sky high.  The counter is lined with small, empty jars 
and a black cauldron used for mixing.

Toys and Noise~
~
{x
This tiny shop is filled with various toys and instruments.  In
every nook and cranny, there are fully finished pieces as well as
toys and instruments still unfinished.  It's clear that the person
creating these items is a bit on the scattered side.  The entire 
shop smells like leather and metal.  The walls are paneled wood,
and the floorboards creak slightly when they are walked upon.  In
all, it is quite a welcoming spot.

A decent sized pub for a decent sized crowd, Ranaugh's Place offers
cozy dark corners for clandestine meetings, as well as a highly
polished mahogany bar lined with several stools.  On the walls hang
various heads of animals - deer, elk, bear, boar, and wolf.  The
floor is coated in a fine layer of sawdust, and creaks whenever weight
is placed upon it.  The smell of stale beer and peanuts resides in the
air, floating in combination with pipe smoke that filters the neon 
lights that color the room.

New Beginnings Cafe~

It isn't the most elegant of dining establishments, but the
New Beginning's Cafe is definitely more upscale than some
places in the realms.  Large murals of seascapes and under-
water images are painted on the walls.  Deep blue tiles cover
the floors, a compliment to the dark wood tables and chairs.
A door to the east leads to the kitchen but is rarely opened,
instead, food is delivered through a open window that connects
the sides.  A magical barrier keeps the sounds of the kitchen
from spoiling the laid-back atmosphere.  There is a sign by
the door.  {W[{YREAD SIGN{W]{x

This room is HOT.  Stoves and ovens are constantly on, cooking up the
orders and baking the breads and pastries for hungry adventurers.  The
room itself is tiled in black and white on the walls, while the floor
is comprised of earthenware tiles.  The stoves and ovens are top of the
line and are coated in a light covering of grime from so much use.  A 
bar for making salads sits in the center of the room and in the back is
a dishwashing station, full of dirty dishes.

This shop is rather small in size, but on every spare inch of wall hangs
some sort of knick-knack, armor piece, weapon, or trinket.  The entire
store smells like musty leather and sweat.  Flickering fire orbs hang in
midair to light the room, growing brighter when night falls.  A few rows 
of shelves sit in the center of the room, loaded with junk.  A counter at
the back of the room holds the cash register, which itself is antique in
appearance.

fluorescent lights.  The floor is a dark marble buffed to a shine.  The

for people to wait upon.  Two large potted plants sit on either side of
the secretary's desk, above which hangs the name of the building in gold
letters: "Survival Pack Factory."  A tall double-door leads into the
factory itself on the northern wall.

Village Path~

A small village sits at the top of this hill.  A total of
five huts sit along the small dirt path.  The smell of 
cooking stew drifts on the breeze and the sound of small
children playing can be heard in the distance.  The largest
hut sits directly to the north.

This small village is very quaint.  The scent of cooking
stew drifts on the breeze along with the sounds of small
children playing.  To the north sits the largest of all
the huts, spilling smoke into the air from its small
chimney that rises up through the thatch roof.

Village Chief's Hut~
~
{x
This is the largest of all the huts on the hill and it is very
large.  The floors are strewn with pelts from various animals
and the walls are lined with elaborate woven rugs.  Pottery sits
along a circular shelf at the top of the hut, while various 
weapons - ceremonial and otherwise - hang from the rafters.  A
large firepit sits in the center of the room, its smoke rising
into a hole at the top of the roof.

This is a very small hut and feels very cramped.  From the 
ceiling hangs various cooking tools as well as weapons and
clothing on lines to dry.  The walls are covered in various
woven tapestries depicting geometric shapes of all colors.
A small mat lays on the floor to one side, and a stove puffs
away on the other side.

The smallest of all the huts, this one has the same dirt

here are much more sparse than they are further down the hill, but
this spot provides a great view of the valley below.

The smell of stale engine oil and rat hangs thickly in the air.
Stalled machines, full of leather pieces to make survival packs,

The smell of stale engine oil and rat hangs thickly in the air.
Stalled machines, full of leather pieces to make survival packs,
sit in silence watching the infestation that has overtaken the
factory.  Florescent bulbs flicker on and off, giving only short
glimpses of the rats that run rampant.

End of Lathander Street~
~
{x
Lathander Street ends - or begins - here.  The red cobblestones
that wind through the small city gives way to a dirt path that
heads uphill.  There is a small sign at the edge of the path
that begs for passersby to take a moment and read.

New Beginnings Bank~
~
{x
The New Beginnings Bank is literally floor to ceiling white marble.
Everything is highly polished and the room shines beneath the fire
orb lights that float about.  The smell of coinage is in the air, 
as is the sound of said coins being counted and moved about.  At the 
far eastern edge of the room is a single barred window where all 
transactions take place.

The red cobblestones of Lathander Street make a turn here,
running south toward the larger part of town and the shops,
and east toward the realms at large.  North lies the Newbie

Marissa's Lights and Lanterns~
~
{x
This shop is bright with the light of hundreds of lamps.  It
is warm and comfortable not to mention small.  The walls are
made of silver, which makes the shop glow all the more.  The
floors are made of white marble, as are the ceilings.  Toward
the rear of the store is a counter lined with scrap metal used
to make the fine lamps and lanterns within the store.
