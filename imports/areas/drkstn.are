You now know that this is the real thing, and that you don't want
to mess around.  The dim light also doesn't help much, since you
nearly bought the farm with the last mercinary run-in.  In fact, you
feel slightly lucky that you were able to dodge that arrow.  Breathing
a sigh of relief is one thing, however, that you know you do not have
the priveledge to do.  The second you stepped into the hallway, yet
another arrow just flew past you.  You quickly ready yourself for
battle, thoughts of leaving now becomming more perswasive.

coulnd't be more wrong.  One of the warriors, and two more rangers are
quickly gearing up at your presence.  You also notice that one of them
holds a key at his belt, but to which door it unlocks, you have no
idea.  You ready yourself as they charge you, crying out "Invaders,

only to be stopped once more, this time by a very large man.  "How did
you get in hear?  Guards?"  He cries, but you smile meekly, knowing
that you already took care of them.  He sighs when no one comes, and
quickly stand up, a sword you never knew he had near him in his hands,
his edge pointing strait at you.  "Must I do EVERYTHING myself?"  He
asks, and quickly charges at you.

Window Overlooking The Countryside~
~
You finally find yourself on the last three steps, and although to
you this room seems to represent nothing but death, you can't help but
look out the window and admire the lovely landscape.  The rolling
hills and valleys, the sparse trees, even a small town very very far
in the distance.  While admiring the view, you hear the scurry of
feet, and turn around to see a man cloaked all in black grinning at
you, at least you think he is grinning.  "Why have you come here?"  He
demands, and you realize he isn't grinning at all, he is growling. 
"We come to end the tyranny of Alzaphain, defend yourself nave or
prepare to eat my sword!"  He grins at you, not at all threatened at
your idle threats, and quickly he pulls out a staff from under his
cloak and beings some sort of incantation.  You quickly lunge for him,
hoping to catch him before his spell is complete.

All this darkness is really beginning to shadow your mood. 
Although you felt somewhat...  Happy at the beautiful landscape, all
that seemed to be sucked away, just as the light.  You press on, fully
aware that in every room, yet another danger awaits you.  You only
hope that you can withstand all the torment and pain, at least until
you get something worth all this trouble.

Another Dark Hallway~
~
Your fears and imagination seem to have gotten the best of you, for
at your own sounds did you jump and prepare for an assault.  You
calmly reassure yourself at every other noise you hear, but you
reassurances fall on deaf ears.  Quickening your pace a bit, as you
are now in the darkest part of the hallway, you find yourself stopped
in your tracks once again by a floating figure.  He glares at you
menacingly, his staff upraised, his eyes beaming white light....  You
almost have to back away at it's brightness.  "You will advance no
more, weary travelers.  This is your last stop!"  He quickly hovers
toward you, laughing maniacally as you rush at him.

Another Dark Hallway~
~
Wiping the blood off your weapons, you are happy that this is the
end of yet another dark hallway.  The path lightens up a bit, and you
are glad to be able to be aware of your surroundings.  After a quick
look-around, you realize that this room seems to actually be empty. 
Halfway through the hallway, something catches your eye.  You quickly
turn to your left, but all you can see is the same concrete wall that
you've seen almost the whole time during this little adventure. 
Thinking this is yet another one of your mind games, you press on,
only to stop after taking a step and this time turn to your right. 
You then quickly step back as the wall moves toward you.  At least,
that's what you think at first.  A voice suddenly utters "Visibility"
and where the wall was, yet another cloaked figure lunges for you. 
You barely have enough time to draw your weapons as he quickly
approaches you.

Alzaphains Mages Conference Room~
~
Feeling like the unluckiest person in the world, you continue on,
even though every bone in your body is begging you didn't.  Hoping
that the worst is perhaps finially over, you're little idea is quickly
disillusioned as your location suddenly dawns on you.  There is a
large wooden circular table in the center of this room, on which many
books lay.  Decorating the walls are books upon books, as well as
scrolls and other objects emanating magical auras.  Your little
sight-seeing session is cut short as three more of the magi you've
been fighting bolt upright in the seats at the large table, and
quickly run in your direction.  "To get this far" one of them yells
"they must have slain our friends.  Let us have no mercy on these men,
leave nothing to identify them!"  The other two nod, and begin weaving
a magical spell as they run at you.

Shizon's Quarters~
~
Having defeated that trio of magi, you're confidence is at quite a
high...  Only to be brought strait back down again at the sight of
your next foe.  The second of Alzaphains generals, Shizon, looks like
someone who could eat you for breakfast.  He actually smiles as you
walk in, not one of friendship, but one of impending doom.  He
casually walks over to you from his desk cluttered with books and
scrolls and walks within 10 feet of you, and then crosses his arms
across his chest.  He looks you up and down as you stare in awe.  He
isn't very tall, only about 5 foot 6, and wears a black robe with a
tied rope around the waist.  The hood of his robe is set back,
revealing his slit-back brown hair and a large scar than runs from the
upper left of his forehead to his lower right cheek.  Having finished
summing you up, he begins an incantation.  Before you can react, both
his hands are clasped in front of his body, and they slowly expand
outward.  A blinding blue light emanates from the increasing gap
between his two hands.  As soon as his hands are about six feet apart,
he finishes his incantation and a large, black, serpent headed staff
lies in his hands.  "Shall we get on with it?"  He muses, and you
quickly respond by charging for him.

You're heart nearly sinks at the sight of yet another large
stairway.  Feeling actually close to exhausted from that previous bout
with Shizon, you don't really know if you can take much more.  But,
you swallow your pride and continue, you won't let some stupid tower
get the best of you.  Taking it one step at a time, you continue on
even if your legs feel like they might go out from under you at any
moment.

Mercinary Conference Room~
~
Out of breath, you lean against the door frame while your breath
eventually catches up with you.  However, the very large mercenary
wielding two rapiers and grinning wildly at you seems to think
otherwise.  It quickly dawns on you that you are now in what seems to
be the mercenary floor, at least that's what reason dictates. 
Decorating the walls are all sorts of trinkets and treasures most
likely taken at raiding parties, as well as weapons that seem to look
somewhat alien to you.  Before you can look around more, the giant
mercenary (which has been motionless the whole time) says "Do you come
here to look or to fight foreigners?  Prepare thyself!"

Dimly Lit Passage~
~
Pocketing the large sum of money from the mercenaries corpse, you
sigh to yourself as you approach yet another dark hallway.  However,
this one seems a bit different from the rest.  Rather than a large
hallway which leads into pitch blackness, you can actually make out an
oak door on the opposite side of where you are standing.  However,
nearly a foot in front of that door is yet another mercenary guard,
both his swords out, which shine brightly in the dim light.  "You are
fools for coming here" he says as he approaches you.  He then slowly
lowers his weapons, and sheaths his swords.  Walking around you, still
eyeing you cautiously, he takes a seat at a desk on the left side of
the hallway.

Ballroom~
~
Shaking your head slightly at the disturbing conversation you just
had with Alexander, you venture on and find yourself in an elaborate
ballroom.  A large crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, which
illuminates the entire room.  It takes your eyes a few minutes to
adjust to the light, but even as you shield your eyes from the
illumination, you can still see the form of yet another mercenary
guard approaching you.  Sighing to yourself, and damning your luck
once more, you try to avoid the guard, but to no avail.  "You are mine
pathetic souls.  You may have defeated ol'Alexander, but you will
never get past me."  Suddenly, in a blur of motion, he releases three
daggers from his hands, all of which miss you, but only because you
have just fallen backwards over a chair trying to avoid the mercenary.
He laughs at you, and suddenly three more daggers appear from his
hands.  "As much as I hated that Alexander bastard, I can't believe he
was beaten by fools like you."  Growling, you leap backwards and
prepare yourself, your eyes as good as they're gonna be.  "Oh, finally
ready to fight?  Let's do it!"  The three daggers then disappear, and
instead two long swords are in his hands.  He then leaps for you,
laughing.

Royal Kitchen~
~
Closing the door behind you, you suddenly with you hadn't slammed
the door shut.  One of the mercenary guards, who was in the process of
fixing a ham and cheese sandwhich, suddenly looks strait at you. 
Dropping the sandwhich to the floor, he quickly arms himself and
charges for you.

Library~
~
Once again, you find yourself in another large library, with books
and scrolls strewn about the premises.  However, you don't really care
much about your surroundings, for right in front of you are two
mercenary guards and one of those wizards from the last floor, all of
whom immediately bolt upright and arm themselves at your intrusion. 
You don't even have time to mouth "Oh Crap" before one of the three
guards leaps for you.

Aralim's Chamber~
~
As quietly as possible, you walk into the chamber of the final
general, in hopes he may be asleep and not notice you.  Sighing with
relief, you notice that he actually IS asleep, or at least meditating.
Aralim doesn't move, so you quickly yet quietly try to sneak past him
in hopes of avoiding him.  If only your luck were that great.  "Who
dares attempt to sneak past the great Aralim, second in command to
Alzaphain."  The figure doesn't move, but you can tell immediatly that
you are found out.  Growling at your luck, you manage a response.  "We
are here to defeat the great Alzaphain, and end his rule of tyranny!" 
The figure appears in front of you, and you suddenly realize...  He is
a vampire!  Grinning at you, his white fangs shining in the light, he
suddenly disappears again.  Turning around, you notice him behind you,
half in the shadows, half in the light.  His eyes are a very bright
red, and he seems to be salivating as he gazes upon you.  "I
believe..."  He starts as he slowly walks toward you, "that it is
feeding time."

A Spiral Stairway~
~
"Christ" you murmur as you approach the final immensely long
staircase, "I hope Alzaphain isn't that hard."  Healing your wounds as
you climb the stairs, you begin to wonder if perhaps there is an
eaiser way to quick fortune and upholding the honor of your kingdom
than this.  Shrugging, you force yourself to climb the last few stairs
and enter the final floor.

A Pitch Black Room~
~
Huffing and puffing, you finally make it to the door of the last
floor.  Carefully, you open the door, panting heavily as you silently
close it behind you.  It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the
darkness; apparently there are no windows whatsoever nor any other
form of light.  As you quickly rummage through your pack to find a
torch, two bright red lights suddenly appear before you.  "So..."  He
whispers, "You thought you could reach my master unhindered?  Prepare
yourself.  It will be a pleasure to drag your lifeless body to his
feet, once I've taken your soul!"  Suddenly, the two bright orbs of
light rush toward you at unimaginable speed.

A Pitch Black Room~
~
Cleaning the sizzling blood from your blades, you carelessly throw
the rag away as you enter a second dark hallway.  Luckily, once you
killed that vampire, you were able to get and light a torch.  Looking
around, you notice that these rooms have no furniture whatsoever, and
in their place rests countless bones of creatures both familiar and
alien to you.  Sighing, you continue on, only to once again be stopped
by yet another black-robed form.  He looks up at you, his red eyes
dancing fire in your torchlight.  He smiles, his fangs growing longer
as he looks at you.  "You will never be able to leave this tower
alive!"  He says, and calmly walks toward you.  You rush him, swinging
your sword at his head, only for your blade to find nothing but air. 
Turning quickly, you notice him behind you, his fangs already nearing
your throat.

A Pitch Black Room~
~
Once again cleaning your blade of the sizzling vampire blood, you
press on, your only form of motivation the fact that this is the final
floor.  And to no surprise, yet another vampire is waiting for you,
smiling a toothy grin.  "You are good warrior, but let me test your
true skills."  With that, his grin suddenly becomes a wicked snarl,
his teeth now fully bared as he lunges for your throat.

A Pitch Black Room~
~
You no longer bother to clean your weapon, the sizzling sound
reminding you of just how deep you are in your own mess.  Sighing, you
really pray that all this effort will pay off and you will be welcomed
back to your town a hero, rather than a coward he ran when the going
got tough.  You look around, expecting a vampire to be hidden
somewhere...  Only nothing happens.  Waiting for about five minutes,
nothing happens, and you cannot hear any other breathing aside from
your own.  Shrugging to yourself, and thanking your good luck, you
begin to walk toward the opposite side of the room, only to be stopped
by a falling bat.  The bat lands in front of you, his eyes blood red. 
He then mouths something you cannot understand, and in a flash of red
light, yet another black robed vampire stands before you.  "TIME TO
DIE!"  He cries, and lunges for you.

A Large Chamber~
~
You walk into the final room which leads to Alzaphains throne,
wounds bleeding, heart throbbing, legs wobbling, but heart full of
determination.  Surprisingly enough, the final room has lights, in
fact it has an elaborate chandelier hanging from the ceiling, giving
more than enough light to the room.  Putting out your torch, you
approach the room cautiously.  "So, you finally arrived."  A voice
speaks, and you turn to face another black robed figure.  "I waited a
long time...  I always love a good challenge."  You prepare yourself
as he walks across a chair to come face to face with you,
approximately 10 paces away.  He stretches his hands out away from
him, and begins to chant a language totally alien to you.  Suddenly,
arms begin to grow out of his arms, and legs from out of his legs. 
His chanting grows louder as two heads and bodies begin to form. 
Suddenly, there are three people, exactly the same, standing before
you.  You cry out as the three leap for you, snarling in anger and
drooling for your blood.

Alzaphains Throneroom~
~
You throw open the door to Alzaphains throneroom, anger and
determination both on your face.  "Alzaphain!"  You should, "Your rule
is at an end!"  A tall man, wearing a white tunic and brown trousers,
with black hair pulled back into a ponytail and black eyes looks down
at you from his high throne.  "Well, if it isn't the warriors I've
been hearing so much of.  You think you can beat me?  I will crush
you, then I will take your land, you towns, your loved ones, and make
them all mine.  You will pay for your insolence."  Alzaphain leaps
down, and suddenly pulls out a large black staff, the head of a dragon
on the butt, and the blade a shimmering white.  It seems to vibrate as
he holds it, most likely craving the taste of blood.  "Don't hold back
now, I want a real challenge.  And to make things interesting..."  He
slams the lance into the ground, and closes his eyes enchanting.  You
try to rush him, but you find your legs immobile...  He has you under
a spell!  A black mist begins to emanate from Alzaphain, and suddenly
three more warriors appear.  One must be a wizard from his attire, the
other a vampire and the third a warrior."  Well, then, let's get
started!"  You're legs gain their mobility, and not a moment too soon.
You charge into the fray, you're only hope that god hasn't decided
it's your time yet.

Spa Room~
~
Happiness is barely the word you feel as you look around this
wonderful room.  All the aches and pains of all the battles you fought
have finally taken their toll.  You nearly collapse from exhaustion as
you approach the welcoming waters of the jacuzzi in the center of this
spa room.  After stripping to nothing but your breeches, you slowly
dip into the jacuzzi, and all your pain seems to be a distant memory. 
You close your eyes, secure in the knowledge that no one will invade
your privacy since you are the only one with the key to this room, and
drift into a peaceful slumber.  Smiling to yourself, you dream of
happy thoughts, which is rather ironic considering your situation. 
After a few hours, you wake, reluctantly leave the jacuzzi, and dress.
Feeling fully refreshed, if a bit hungry, you decide it's time to
reach the top of this tower.
