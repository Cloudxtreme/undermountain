Tunnel in the Mountain~
~
The path ends into a large tunnel.  The lighting is very poor, if any in
some spots.  The ground is dry and the air is a bit nippy.  Noises reach out
of the shadows...  Who knows what could be making them.  The tunnel appears
to go on, although no light can be seen at the other end.

Tunnel in the Mountain~
~
The tunnel continues, with no apparent end.  The lighting is still low,
and a cool breeze blows through your hair.  The tunnel itself looks odd,
almost man made.  The walls are smooth and cold, with only a few
outcroppings.  Wherever this goes, it doesn't seem to go to any primitive
place.

Tunnel in the Mountains~
~
The tunnel makes a sharp turn, and seems to still go on.  Still no light
can be seen from another end.  The air is getting colder, but yet it isn't
uncomfortable.  The wind blows calmly, finding small cracks to whistle
through.

The tunnel still goes on, getting colder as you go.  The wind is picking
up a bit, but not much.  As you stare into the darkness, a faint glimmer of
light catches your eye.  Is this the end of the tunnel, or someone else?

Opening in the Tunnel~
~
The tunnel widens until it is no more.  Before you lies a vast city,
bustling with people walking around, going in buildings, and talking amongst
themselves.  The air is cold, and it sinks down to your bones, yet it isn't
uncomfortable.  Wherever this place is, it seems to be a perfect place.

Ice Street~
~
The tunnel leaves off and Ice street begins.  The road isn't all that
icy, but maybe it's just the temperature today.  People walk about, not
really caring that you're here.  The city looks pretty impressive from where
you are.  This road continues north.

Ice Street~
~
The steet continues, and it looks like there's an intersection ahead. 
You see buildings ans shops on neighboring streets, with the assortment of
people with them.  The temperature is still cold, and the wind is blowing
softly.  This street goes north and south.

Entrance to the Guild of Wizzards~

You stand in a large entrance room, filled with wall coverings and rugs. 
The walls themselves appear to be made of wood and stone.  It is slightly
warmer in here than outside, but the colder air had a certain comfort to it.

Guild of Wizzards~
~
You have entered a large room, with stone walls, and some wood.  The
floor is wood, with carpets thrown about.  There are wizards standing about,
reading in books or just sitting around.  Bookshelves line the walls,
apparently filled with spellbooks and scrolls.  It is slightly warmer in
here than the outside.

This is the end of Ice Street, and where Crescent Street picks up.  You
may go east or west, as so the street appears to lead.  People come in and
out of buildings, which cover the city.  The street is made of stone, and
has a slight frost on it.  You catch a snowflake out of the corner of your
eye.

You walk along Crescent Street, which travels east and west from the
entrance.  There are darker sections on the city to both sides on you, and
to the north appears to be near the town center.  A giant tower looms
overhead, it reminds you of something...

and there are rugs strewn about the room.  The air remains chilly here, but
along with the coldness lies protection, the protection of The Secret Order
of the Emperor.

Below you the waves splash against each other, in the stormy waters.  You
seem to be getting closer to the large structure, but you still can't place
it in your mind.  The area is getting darker, and the water is getting
rougher.

flying a little closer than comfort.  Before you lies a massive tower, but
it's not like any tower you've seen before...

Rocky Shore~

You have finally crossed the dark lake, only to be met with a bleak and
dreary shore, covered with rocks.  You see nothing important here...  Until
you glance upwards.  A massive tower looms overhead, creating a huge shadow
over your cowering form.  The tower itself looks like a gigantic tree, a
trunk coming out of the ground, but then turns into a huge spherical top. 
The sphere is dark grey, and multiple windows can be seen all over it.

somewhere.  Those birds are still flying about the tree, searching,

Inn of Shadows~
~
You have entered the Inn of Shadows, a large Inn/Tavern in Polaris.  The
lighting is dim, and the lights that do exist create shadows around
everything else.  That's probably where it got the name.  There are tables
spread around the room, and a bar sits off to the side.  There is a small
stage in the corner where the entertainment performs.
