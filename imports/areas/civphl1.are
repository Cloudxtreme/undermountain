who may not know he has a big heart to fit his big body.
All his hair is a pale bronze, including his beard which
hangs nearly to his waist tied neatly here and there.

Myralie sits at a corner table reading when not serving customers.
~
The waitress, a tall human with brown hair and eyes, seems
to be in her early thirties.  She tends to all the patrons
in the dining room with a pleasant demeanor,  occasionally
offering one of the regulars a world-wise smirk, showing a
bit of hardness through her soft, rather attractive face.

Timothea~
Timothea~
The innkeeper, Timothea, sits behind her desk sipping ale from a tall mug.
~
A thin woman runs the reception desk, offering rooms
to those wishing to stay at the Laughing Goblin Inn.
Her pale orangish hair is pulled up into a tight bun
atop her head, little frizzes sticking out along her
hairline.  She wears a contented smile and rose-tint
to her cheeks. Perhaps she's had too much ale today.

Fairuza~
{wF{*airuza{x~
Fairuza sits behind her counter petting a pitch black fluttercat.
~
Unusually thin, even for an elf, Fairuza looks like she should
spend more time in the kitchen and less with her kittens.  Her
black clothing bears a thin layer of cat fur which goes easily
unnoticed at a distance.  She wears her raven-black hair short
cropped, framing her rather feline face nicely.  She rarely is
caught smiling, prefering to conduct business quite seriously.

{yWestern {yWalk{x~
~
This broad dirt road seems to get a decent bit of traffic,
connecting Scholars' Square to the south with the industrial
sector to the north. Dominating the western side of the road
are dormitories and cheap housing for the scholarly folk who
frequent Mantor's Library and its vicinity.   The wall which
surrounds the city rises up beyond those buildings, right at
the edge of Phlan Bay. A shop is nearby to the east, strange
gems sparkling in its side windows; the door would likely be
around south.  Looking north, the Cadorna Textile House sits
on the far horizon, just barely visible.

The finely rounded and worn cobblestones of the square end
here, giving way to a large dirt road to the north and a few
smaller paths to the west leading to private residences.  To
the east all the bustle of wizardly and artistic life can be
found within Scholars' Square,  Phlan's center of knowledge,
art, and magic.   Some shops can be seen lining the northern
walk while to the south stands Mantor's Library, a structure
of grand proportion and age. The restored library is home to
a rather fine collection of texts and acts as the hub of the
educated quarter.  The road leading north, in contrast, is a
dusty and dirty path running  parallel to the city's western
well and ending in the industrial sector.

Elegant shops and scholastic establishments line Scholars'
Square.  The two most notable on this stretch of cobblestone
road are the lapidary to the north and the famous library to
the south. From here, one can barely peer across the library
lawn to peek in the tall windows,  but even at this distance
it is easy to see the rows of neatly arranged books.  A sign
blows in the breeze above the shop door to the north.  A gem
is painted upon it between the words Beholder's Eye. Rows of
glittering jewels arranged in  velvet display cases look out
on the square through a crystal clear window. The road seems
to end to the west, becoming more residential, but continues
to the east, through the square and toward Kuto's Well Road.

A little silver bell above the door jingles when customers
enter or exit this little shop, drawing the attention of the
aged dwarf behind the marble-topped counter. Finely engraved
scrollwork lines the edges of cool white marble,  upon which
rest several small glass cases glittering in the candlelight
flickering about the shop. Inside the cases, stones of every
shape and size bear price tags for every budget. Most of the
stones are not set in any sort of jewelry,  but could easily
be fitted.  When not dealing with customers, the shopkeeper,
Deryk Stoneshaper, is patiently cutting and polishing gems.

The northern corner of Scholars'  Square is set beteween a
music store and the famous Denelor's Tower. Many instruments
line the shop window, from mundane to exotic.  A sign before
them reads "Specializing in Bardic Instruments" but the sign
above the door declares the establishment  the Bearded Bard.
Even from behind, Denelor's Tower is rather impressive. It's
rather obviously the oldest  and tallest structure in Phlan.
The cobblestone road winding through this sector of the city
leads west toward more shops and residential areas and south
toward famed Mantor's Library and the small bookstore run by
the librarian and his twin brother.

The Bearded Bard~
~
One of the most interesting and popular shops in Phlan, the
Bearded Bard is also one of the newest.  Nearly always, music
rings through the store, either from patrons trying out their
purchases or the owner Bertram Bellwhistle playing a song for
his customers. Bertram has traveled much of the realms and is
gaining a reputation, now that he's settled in Phlan, for his
fine tale-telling and magnificent playing. Many of his unique
instruments have been gathered during his travels, but almost
all of the store's wares have  been carved with Bertram's own
hands. A few flutes and horns and lutes of various shapes and
sizes are arranged in the front window which looks out on the
lovely Scholars' Square.

The southern corner of Scholars' Square is nestled between
the renowned Mantor's Library and Brothers Aspermere Books &
Maps which is owned and operated by the librarian Pontus and
his twin brother Pius.  The grand library building stands to
the west.  It has clearly undergone renovation recently, its
stonework finely polished, its wood still looking fresh.  An
enormous set of double doors mark the entrance,  above which
are carved the words "Nam et ipsa scientia potestas est." In
the shop window,  a map of the Moonsea region is prominently
displayed among several books on local geography and legend.
To the north, Scholar's Square  continues with more shops of
esoteric interests, and to the east lies Kuto's Well.

This stretch of Moonsea Road  stands directly between two
of Phlan's most famous landmarks: {YK{Duto's {YW{Dell {xand {rT{Draitor's{x
{rG{Date{x.  At least one well-armed guard stands to the west and
keeps guard over the well at all times. To the east, no one
guards the gate over the {DBarren River{x and few citizens make
use of it. On the other side lies a temple to Bane, gardens
full of poisonous plants surrounding it.  To the southeast,
the tall crystalline spires of the {cC{Ch{Wap{Ce{cl {xof {YR{Ra{rd{yia{rn{Rc{Ye{x stand
proud.  To the northeast, an elegant green building with an
old cracked crown above the door sees little business.

One of Phlan's finer establishments stands to the east of
this stretch of Moonsea Road.  Its painted walls--a subdued
forest green--and front step are kept clean.  No sign hangs
upon the building,  but a bronze crown above the door marks
it as the {YC{yracked {YC{yrown{x.  The building to the north, purely
practical, presents an odd contrast to such elegance.  Just
a short distance southwest is the site of the famous {YK{Duto's{x
{YW{Dell{x; while to the southeast the equally infamous {rT{Draitor's{x
{rB{Dridge{x crosses the Barren River.

A sturdy building, clearly built for function rather than
aesthetic, stands on the eastern side of the road, its back
to the {*B{barren {*R{biver{x. Upon its door hangs an old shortsword,
its blade battered and knicked from seemingly many years of
use.  It seems, however, freshly polished.  The wood behind
it has been painted, yellow flame upon a red shield.  Above
the sword's point at the top of the shield, a bronze plaque
declares this building {*S{Wwo{*r{wd{*h{Wal{*l{x, Temple of Tempus.  To the
north, Podol Plaza can be glanced in the distance, while to
the south, tourists pass by famous landmarks such as {YK{*uto's
{YW{*ell{x.  A wooden building, stables by the smell and sound of
it, stands to the west, reeking faintly of horse droppings.

Those traveling this span of {CM{coonsea {CR{coad{x would be unable
to ignore the tall, proud temple to the east.  Tall crystal
spires stretch to the sky, set into the white marble of the
building. Golden accents glitter in the light, most obvious
of which is a plague above the door, designating the temple
the {cC{Ch{Wap{Ce{cl {xof {YR{Ra{rd{yia{rn{Rc{Ye{x, devoted church of Sune Firehair. To
the west stands another stone building, this one a bit more
rough-hewn. Sounds of metal banging against metal ring from
its walls frequently.  Southward along Moonsea Road, one is
bound to pass by, if not through, the {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x.  To the north
stands {rT{*raitor's {rB{*ridge{x and Kuto's Well, two famed historic
landmarks important to Phlan's history.

Roaming this section of Moonsea Road, the occasional meow
can be heard from the shop to the east  over the bustle and
noise of the {yb{*a{wza{*a{yr{x to the west.  As long as the sun is up,
the bazaar is full of life and activity, merchants of every
variety selling their wares to passersby. Sweet smells from
the various food vendors fill the air.  The eastern windows
look in on a shop filled with  napping and playing cat-like
creatures. The sign above the door swings in the wind. Upon
it is painted an elegant black cat sitting regally with its
white wings held high. Beside the winged cat are the words,
painted in cursive lettering: {MF{mairuza{M'{ms {MF{mlying {MF{melines{x.

Bordered to the east by {CM{coonsea {CR{coad{x and by more stalls
in most other directions, this corner of the {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x swims
with activity.  Vendors and patrons of all shapes, sizes,
and ethnicities sell and buy wares of every color, shape,
and substance.  The sound of metal pounding against metal
can often be heard to the north,  ringing from the famous
forge of {RM{wa{Wth{we{*o{x, renowned weaponsmith. The quality of his
weaponry is beyond compare and attracts buyers from round
the Moonsea region. Across the road to the east is a shop
with paned windows.  The sign above its door has a rather
odd {Mw{minged {Mc{mat{x painted upon it.

The front of this large stone building is well lit with a
few copper lanterns hanging from the walls among the wooden
racks.  Held on the many racks,  a decent variety of blades
display the excellent quality of Matheo's work. Adventurers
and warriors come from around the Moonsea region  solely to
purchase Matheo's weapons. Past the wooden table which acts
as the sales counter is the forge where Matheo works. It is
unbearably hot back there even though the rest of the store
is kept reasonably cool by the stone structure.   Customers
are welcome to look at the weapons,  removing them from the
racks upon which they rest, but warning signs are posted by
each rack reading: {*You {Rblood {*it, you {Ybuy {*it{x.

The smell of fresh citrus and breads waft into the area
from the west entering this corner of the {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x from old
{yC{gockburn's {yG{grocery{x.  Citizens of the city pass in and out
of the sturdy building gathering their daily meals, quite
unnoticed by the patrons of the Bazaar, many of which are
tourists.   It is fairly likely that they've just drifted
in from the north,  where {YK{*uto's {YW{*ell {YR{*oad{x leads directly
to the well itself, an important historic landmark. Other
shops, as well as {MS{ccholar's {MS{cquare{x can be found that way.
The other directions seem little more than a continuation
of the grand maze of carts, stalls and tents that make up
the daily Bazaar.

{yC{gockburn's {yG{grocery{x~
~
This store is a maze of crates and boxes and shelves, all
loosely organized perhaps by color or texture,  as no other
discernable pattern is obvious.  The crates are filled with
the staples most need,  be they city-dweller or adventurer.
Dried meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, some cookware all
fill the front of the store, while toward the back are some
fresh cheeses, milk, a small selection of fresh meats and a
counter with a scales and brown wrapping paper.  There is a
small sign with thick black letters upon the countertop. It
would be easy to miss among all the clutter.

~
Wandering the labyrinth of vendors and stalls, one might
end up in this darkest corner of the {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x.  The shadiest
individuals come to deal with the greediest merchants here
where the eye of the law seems to remain only half open. A
few of the dealers may seem reputable, their wares perhaps
of finer quality than most,  but their prices are also the
highest by far.   Pressed to the {BC{bity {BH{ball{x building to the
south, a perfect irony exists here: corruption right under
the very seat of justice.  Still,  one can hardly help but
browse the strange goods sold here, eyeing the merchandise
as one is eyed by the bazaar's regulars.  To the west is a
rather small, battered building, a sign bearing a bell and
the words {yN{*at {yW{*yler's {yB{*ell{x swinging above its door.

A stench of cheap ale and stale smoke seems to have sunk
right into the wood,  becoming a permanent fixture of this
small inn.  Tables are scattered about the room; a few are
surrounded by drunken patrons,  caught up in conversation.
Along the back wall is an old bar, behind which are a pair
of odd items. The first is a platform raised a couple feet
from the ground, stretching the length of the bar,  making
bartending a bit easier for the gnomish barkeep. The other
is a bit more extraordinary: it is Nat Wyler himself, dead
twenty years or more now, hold a large bronze bell.  There
is a wobbly wooden staircase leading to the common room on
the second floor, a free stay gladly given with sufficient
purchase of the bar's bland food and cheap ale.

Wandering through the dizzying maze of tents, stalls, and
booths that make up the {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x, one could quickly get lost.
The smells of sweet breads and confections drift in from an
indiscernable direction.   The sounds of coins being passed
and deals being made fills every corner of the bazaar. Mats
and tables and carts are covered with {Wt{wri{*nk{wet{Ws{x and rarities
of all sorts.   The selection of people wandering this part
of the city is just as wide:  the working class looking for
cheap goods; the affluent and influential seeking stranger,
less common items.  The {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x has pushed itself right upto
the back of the City Hall  building with its draped windows
to the south.  {CM{coonsea {CR{coad{x lies to the east, and {YJ{ye{*rro{ym{Ye{y's{x
waits right across the street, doing fair business.

This section of the beautiful Moonsea Road is bordered on
the west by the constant commotion of the city's {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x.  A
broad array of smells and sounds fill the air. To the east,
a shop with broad display {Ww{window{Ws{x, filled with many strange
items, attracts both respectable and shadier clientelle.  A
sign shaped into a thick disk and painted gold,  resembling
a coin, hangs above the door, swaying in the sea breeze. It
reads {YJ{ye{*rro{ym{Ye{y's {xof {cM{welvaunt{x  and gives little indication of
the store's nature.  The docks and the governmental offices
are to the south.  More shops and the famed {YK{*uto's {YW{*ell{x lie
to the north.

Every manner of item rests upon the shelves of this shop.
From trinkets and heirlooms to kitchenry and weaponry, that
which can be bought and sold  is {ybought {xand {Ysold{x right here
at {YJ{ye{*rro{ym{Ye{y's{x.  Rumor has it, though it's not spoken loudly,
that whatever you want,  Jerrome can get--for a price and a
little time, of course. {*M{wi{Wrro{wr{*s{x are hung in all the corners 
of the shop, allowing Jerrome full view of his merchandise,
and of any potential shop-lifters.   Though the place seems

The smell of salt air drifts in from the south where this
cobblestone street leads out toward the docks bordering the
{CB{cay{x of {CP{chlan{x.  The effect is amplified by the smell of fish
freshly fried wafting from the old building to the east.  A
wooden sign hangs above the door bearing a faded shortsword
and the barely legible words The {BB{cit{wte{Wr {wBl{cad{Be{x.  A couple of
windows look in on City Hall to the west,  revealing little
more than blandly colored curtains.  During daylight hours,
people pass through the large open area to the north buying
and selling wares of all variety at the city's {yB{*a{wza{*a{yr{x.

Salt, seafood, and smoke fill the small tavern with an odd
though not entirely unappealing aromatic ambience.   Several
round wooden tables, looking a bit worse for wear, fill most
of the dimly lit room.  A few square {ytables{x are pushed right
against the eastern wall.  To the left, when one enters, the
bar stretches nearly the full length of the tavern,  curling
at the end to leave room for passage to the store rooms.  An
old {*s{who{Wrtsw{wor{*d{x, rusted by the sea air, hangs behind the bar,
its blade pointing north.  A strange statue of a {gm{Ge{Wr{wm{Wa{Gi{gd{x has
been tucked in the southwestern corner and forgotten, easily
overlooked by the patrons, most of whom are sailors who have
likely seen their fair share of the temptresses.

Travelling this stretch of Moonsea Road, one can not help
but notice the large, vibrantly painted {ym{wu{Wr{wa{yl{x covering most
of the building to the east.   The windowless side of {wT{Wyr's{x
{wT{Wemple{x depicts a scene so large  it is difficult to take in
from this perspective. The whole of the mural recreates {wT{Wyr{x
sacrificing his hand to {*K{ge{Gz{ge{*f{x for the safety of mortals and
gods alike. Pictured here is the Chaos Hound, his grotesque
maggot-infested body shown in horrific detail. He stands on
his hind paws as a {Yc{yhai{Yn{x binds his bulk.  Between his razor
sharp teeth {wT{Wyr{x holds his right hand as a show of {Whonor{x.

The most notable feature along this piece of Moonsea Road
is {wT{Wyr's {wT{Wemple{x to the east and its magnificent {ym{wu{Wr{wa{yl{x.  The
whole mural is too large to see in its entirity from such a
close perspective.  Still, one can gather quite easily that
it depicts the monumental event in which {wT{Wyr{x lost his right
hand to the {MC{mh{*a{mo{Ms {*H{go{Gu{gn{*d{x. In this half of the grand painting
{wT{Wyr{x stands, a bearded warrior dressed in light armor, sword
held in his left hand.   His face is both stern and loving,
like that of a father making {Rs{ra{*c{wr{Wi{wf{*i{rc{Re{x for his children. He
holds his right hand out to Kezef, steady between the teeth
which are poised to feast on his flesh.

The intersection of Moonsea Road and Tyran Way is certainly
one of the busiest junctions in Phlan,  sitting admist two of
the city's most important buildings as well as its most loved
tavern.  {wT{Whe {wW{Waiting{x, Tyr's most recent temple established in
Phlan, resides in the old courthouse which has been renovated
to accomodate the priesthood.  The welcoming doors are to the
east, open to all. To the northwest stands {BC{bity {BH{ball{x; the two
story establishment is one of the oldest in the city.  South,
the passenger docks and the Laughing Goblin bustle with life,
while to the north lies the main shopping district.

A fine old building, the walls and floors of The Waiting
are solid oak. A small waiting area rests right inside the
door, a few crimson padded seats ordered neatly around the
room. A southern window streams in sunlight during midday.
Across from the entrance is  a solid oak door opening into
the old courtroom,  preserved to this day in this house of
justice.  The traditional Tyran symbol of golden scales on
top of a golden hammer hangs on the door. A few priests go
about their priestly duties and help guide visitors to the
proper rooms. To the north one will find a better place to
worship Tyr as well as the church's offices.

The old Phlanarian courtroom looks much as it did when it
was used over a century ago.  The careful work of the Tyran
priesthood has left a beautifully restored oak-paneled room
with raised benches for the judges and finely polished pews
for the patrons.  A podium stands before the judges' stand,
allowing a proper forum for one to plead their case. On the
wall behind the judges' dais hangs a grand tapestry showing
the Blind God in battered armor, his blank stare gazing out
over the courtroom, a vigilant reminder that he watches all
the proceedings heard here and that justice will be served.

Beyond the broad arch lay the primary worship area of The
Waiting.  Well-polished wooden pews line either side of the
wide walk to the pulpit. Hooded brass lanterns hang on both
side walls, offering a warm light. Behind the large pulpit,
a large paneled window looks out over the Barren River.  An
altar of finely polished grey  granite rises from the dais.
Upon its face has been chiseled and painted Try's symbol, a
set of golden scales upon a golden hammer. By the door sits
a small brass collection place for donations and tithes.

Boxes, safes and shelves bear the wealth of Tyr's church.
Arms and armor and tomes all are stacked in this small back
room which houses the  savings the church has amassed while
it has waited a long time, planning to reclaim the original
temple, now run by priests of Bane. It is a fine horde, but
far from large enough to quash so strong an enemy, one that
has woven itself into Phlan's society.  So the church waits
as their weapons grow dull and dusty.  Still, should anyone
need to equip in Tyr's name, they'd find sufficient weapons
and funds here.

This office seems rather plain.  Its walls are bare, save
for a holy symbol of Tyr and the Bishop's credentials.  The
back wall has a small window which looks across an alley at
the Bitter Blade tavern. The sturdy wood desk in the middle
of the room is covered in short, neat stacks of paper.  Two
cushioned chairs sit in front of it, another behind it. The
eastern wall holds a door which is almost always closed and
locked.  The southern door leads back into The Waiting.

The wide oaken hallway of Tyr's Temple leads from the old
courtroom back to the more  religious areas of The Waiting.
To the east, a wide arched doorway remains open most hours,
its double doors pulled aside  to allow clergy and visitors
alike to worship Tyr in a more traditional setting.  To the
north is another door, upon which hangs a small sign noting
that this is the office of Bishop Holondos Stimpiir.  There
are no windows in this hallway as the stone wall outside is
painted in a grand mural.  Some light, however, shines from
the brass lanterns hung on the walls.

building to the south look in on much merriment and revelry
while the windows to the north look in on the quiet offices
of city councilmen.  Looking to the east, one can see Tyr's
Temple in all its glory. Painted on the side of {wT{Whe {wW{Waiting{x

own right hand to save all from Kezef's unrelenting hunger.

its doors always open to the public.   The windows facing

A slight aroma of fresh fish wafts from the building to

The commercial docks and the {WP{*ortmaster's {WO{*ffice{x both are

The commotion of the commercial docks along the Bay of

by the dozen line the southern docks.  A shaky old, sea-
worn building stands to the west, bearing a sign for the

to the east looks nearly as old, but in better repain. A
second story balcony looks out from the {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin{x,

This little building seems little more than a large mess 
of paperwork and crates.  There does seem to be some small 
amount of organization, however.  A sign on the south wall 
reads Shipping, while a sign to the north reads Receiving. 
Most of the crates are sealed shut and arranged by company 
or transport ship. Some of the crates are opened as clerks 
sort and inventory the contents. A long desk sits amid the 
mess, covered in its own cluttered:  a large assortment of 
packing slips and port logs, stacked in loose piles sorted 
with the same casual organization as the crates.  A locked 
door in the back of office bears a sign reading Private.

the famed {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin {GI{gnn{x bustles with activity. On the
opposite side of the road,  the doors of the local training
hall swing open as warriors of all shapes and sizes come to
test their might in its {Ra{rr{Re{rn{Ra{x.  The passenger docks where a
visitor may book passage to Thorn Island lies to the south,
while to the north, tourists and locals alike hurry through
the busy intersection near {WT{wyr's {WT{wemple{x and City Hall.

The southern end of Moonsea Road looks out over the lovely
{CB{cay {xof {CP{chlan{x.   Ships move in and out of the passenger docks
throughout the day.  A large ferry with the words {RS{rokol {RK{reep
{RT{rours{x painted on the bow comes and goes at regular intervals
carrying visitors to and from {YT{yhorn {YI{ysland{x. Tickets are sold
in the office to the east.  To the west,  much merriment can
be heard from the best inn in the city, The Laughing Goblin.
The great expanse of the city  stretches northward along the
worn cobblestones of {CM{coonsea {CR{coad{x.

Sokol Keep Tours~
~
A sturdy old desk sits in the middle of the small office of
Sokol Keep Tours. A faded {yp{*a{wi{cnt{wi{*n{yg{x of the old keep in all its
glory hangs on the beige wall behind the desk. A couple cases
display various artifacts dating back a couple hundred years.
A few dusty information pamphlets and a {Ws{wig{Wn{x are on the desk.
The whole room seems rather drab and unimpressive, save for a
bright smile beaming from the secretary behind the desk.  She
offers visitors tickets to Thorn Island to see Sokol Keep.

Due to the recent appropriation of Sokol Keep
by the Phlanarian Navy, tours are now limited
to the courtyard and chapel. We hope you will
feel as we do that Thorn Island is still well
worth a visit.  We have lowered our prices to
reflect this change.       Thank you!

{xThe {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin {GI{gnn{x~
~
Seldom does the large main room of the {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin{x get
a moment of quiet as its tables are always filled with loud,
raucous folk drinking to their hearts' content.  In spite of
the noise, the crowd seems good-natured, sharing stories and
laughs with one another.  Past the tables, a large horseshoe
shaped {ybar{x protrudes from the western wall. A wide selection
of liquor is displayed behind it,  but most seem to stick to
the ale. Sometimes, the upright {Wp{*i{Wa{*n{Wo{x by the northern window
delights the room with bright music played at the fingers of
one of the tavern's patrons or its dwarven owner. Beyond the
boisterous bar crowd, a swinging door leads to a back room.

{xThe {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin {GI{gnn{x~
~
Though the clamor of the bar room can still be heard, this
room is far {*q{wu{Wiet{we{*r{x.  A few patrons sit at neatly set tables
eating their meals and talking amongst themselves.   Without
the distraction of the crowd, it is easier to get a feel for
the age of this building.  Its {ywo{*o{yd{x-{ypan{we{yl{x {yw{*al{yls{x seem to have
been patched several times, many boards varying in color and
age.  Still, the tavern offers a respectable and comfortable
atmosphere, magnified in the dining hall by its homey decor.
The many {cw{Ci{Wn{wd{Wo{Cw{cs{x look out on the docks, offering a fine view
during daylight. In the evening, the room is softly lit with
candlelight.  A set of {ys{*t{yai{*r{ys{x leads up to the inn rooms, and
a door marked "Employees Only" leads into the kitchen.

The upstairs of the inn bears the same hardwood floors and
paneled walls, but a fine imported carpet covers much of the
hallway.  Against the eastern wall is a small desk with some
papers and a guest log book sprawled on its surface.  A {*sign{x
hangs behind the desk giving the rates for a stay at the inn
in one of its {Ml{movel{My r{moom{Ms{x. To either side of the sign hangs
a painting: the left capturing the beautiful Bay of Phlan as
it may have looked a long time ago, its waters crystal blue;
the right depicting the {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin{x from the outside, as
it may have looked decades ago. At either end of the hall is
a door leading to one of the inn rooms.

A beautiful mahogany scroll bed rests against the center of
the western wall, clothed in {Br{bega{Bl{x blue bedding.  Pillows are
stacked at the head of the bed and a couple rest on the chair
by the {cw{Ci{Wn{wd{Wo{Cw{cs{x.  Two windows look out over the beautiful city
of Phlan, each draped in two layers of curtains:  sheer white
to let in the sun  and thick midnight blue for total privacy.
Beneath the windows, next to the armchair, a table crafted of
finest mahogany holds {GL{gaughing {GG{goblin {*s{wt{Watione{wr{*y{x  and a quill
and inkwell.  The view of the city is marvelous to the right,
peeking around the city hall building  which takes up much of
the view to the left.   Even the {*B{warren {*R{wiver{x and old {RV{raljevo
{RC{rastle{x can be seen to the east beyond Tyr's Temple.

A large four-poster bed with {Re{rlegan{Rt{x crimson bedding rests
against the eastern wall, welcoming guests to take a relaxing
nap.  Two thickly cushioned scarlet armchairs surround a long
mahogany table with stretches along the southern wall beneath
two {cw{Ci{Wn{wd{Wo{Cw{cs{x that look out on the busy docks.   Sheer curtains
and heavy scarlet drapes are hung upon the windows as well as
above the sliding glass door to the west which leads out onto
the {yb{walcon{yy{x. The gentle light of red {Rc{ra{yn{Yd{yl{re{Rs{x set in cast iron
candelabras fills the room with a warm ambience. The noise of
the tavern below and the city outside are hardly even audible
from the comforts of this fine room.

Sturdy {*iron{x railings line the balcony overlooking the bay.
The floor is solid, but shows the wear and weathering it has
taken over time. Surprisingly spacious, the balcony fits two
people quite comfortably. A deep red chaise lounge sits near
the door, looking quite comfortable. The {Yv{yie{Yw{x is spectacular
from here.  To the right stretches the whole city, while the
{CB{cay {xof {CP{chlan{x can be seen clearly straight ahead.  The waters
of the bay glisten in daylight as well as moonlight.  In the
center of the bay floats {YT{yhorn {YI{ysland{x,  upon its surface the
ruins of the once strong Sokol Keep.

This shop is surprisingly small, made to seem smaller by the
large number of winged felines perched all about. The scent of
{Gc{gatni{Gp{x lingers in the air,  radiating from a rather tall plant
to the right of the door.  A few of the strange {Ww{Ci{Wng{Ce{Wd{x kitties
nibble on the leaves while others lounge about in soft pillows
lined up on {*s{yhelve{*s{x that  span the eastern and northern walls.
A wooden counter stretches the length of the western wall with
stuffed mice, collars, and other cat accessories covering it.

{yCommon Room {*at {yW{*yler's {yB{*ell{x~
~
This large second floor room at Nat Wyler's Bell smells
even worse than the one below.  Too many drunks must have
staggered up the stairs,  passing out on one of the linen
cots lining the far wall. Some of them likely have lost a
meal or two here, leaving a sweetly acidic smell of vomit
on the floor and furniture.   Dying embers smolder in the
small brick fireplace, before which rest a couple chairs,
threadbare foot rests at their feet.  The carpet spanning
most of the room may have once been quite fine, something
from a far off land perhaps, but now the colors are faded
and it bears large amorphous stains.  This might not be a
pleasant place to sleep, but in a pinch, it'll do.
