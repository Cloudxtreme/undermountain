{bW{Bi{Wsd{Bo{bm{x~
A cloaked old man sits before the fireplace.
~
A cloaked man sits before the blazing fireplace, his eyes filled
with wonder and mystery.  He tells tales to the children of the city,
their mouths often open in awe.  Tales of battle and victory, love and
sorrow.  A truly wise man.  He has seen much in this world.

nostalgia old farmer stands standing field sowing sows seeds~
{rN{Ro{Ys{Wtal{Yg{Ri{ra{x~
An old farmer stands in a field, sowing seeds.
~
A farmer can be seen off in the distance, a hat covering his head
as he wipes his brow from the work.  His hand often dips his hand into
a large sack, and pulls from it a handful of seeds that he lets fly
over the freshly plowed land.  An old man yes, a stupid old farmer? 
No..

A short man dressed in silken robes tells time.
~
A strange looking fellow stands in the center of a large
cobblestone clock.  Though unmoving, the stones seem to tell the time
of the realms.  The man is dressed in silken robes, and smiles as you
arrive.  Upon his chest is a large clock that ticks noisily of the
current time.  Often he peers at it, adjusts it, then places it back
on his chest..

An old woman sits at a table in a wooden chair.

An old woman sits in a chair.  She mumbles to herself frequently
and sometimes looks up at you to tell you a few things.  When she
speaks to you, the words don't seem to make sense, then she looks back
down at the table again.  She's speaking of her life..  Your life..

MOB NOTES: Should be invisible to mortals. Has mprog to trigger on a login event...a short
delay and then a force vis, nonlethal damage, then a transfer to the nightmare room in
abstract. Is here to combat the growing habit of LOGGING OUT IN A HERO RUN AREA. Questions,
concerns, or comments should be noted to Michelson on '62 or Dugmaren on '60.  Thank you!

overhead.  To the west the trail continues on, but this time as a
large wooden hall with paintings on both sides.

{wF{Wl{8a{rshb{8a{Wc{wk{x - A Strange Encounter~
~
You are at the end of the cobblestone alley.  In the center a large
circle is formed on the ground in cobblestones.  Within the large
circle stands a man, his robes are made of blue silks, and he glows
lightly with an aura of good.  Around his neck is a large silver chain
attached to a large clock that lays upon his chest.  To the north the
alleyway continues on, leading to the town.

~
The large cobblestone street of a city can be seen to the north,
while this smaller street stretches to a small house to the south. 
The street is also made of cobblestone, but the skies are clear
overhead.  To the north however, the clouded skies can be seen
pounding rain down upon the streets.

{wF{Wl{8a{rshb{8a{Wc{wk{x - Lost Memories~
~
You are within a small wooden house, consisting only of two rooms:
the living room which you stand in, and the kitchen to the east.  The
living room is plain with a chair and a table.  In the chair sits a
woman, her face is old with age as she has spent her whole life here. 
She recounts the memories to herself, retelling every story as if it
were yesterday.  To the north the door leads out to the street from
which you came.

You are on the edge of a ravine, to the north it is nothing but a
sheer drop of the stony face.  The skies overhead are a bright pink
color that slowly fades to blue, and back to pink again.  To the east
and west velvet ropes stop you from travelling in those directions.  A
large glowing portal stands here, speaking strange words to you.

You are floating in mid-air above a sea of churning shadows. 
Bunnies flutter by on gossamer wings while the sky overhead melts and
drips a muckly purple substance.  To the south a large stone cliff
juts up, its face as sheer as a pancake.  To the north the air
continues to float.

A pair of signs stand here, pointing to the east and south.  To the
north and west piles of gold and jewels sit, waiting to be pillaged. 
But in your attempts at moving towards them, you are held back.  The
only ways you suppose you can go, is east and south.  But..  The piles
are definately shiny.

why his tail is missing.  To the west piles of gold and jewels glitter
in the light, while to the east a large stony cliff stands mightily. 
Its eyes flutter lightly.

You are on the edge of a large stony cliff.  Unlike any other
cliff, this one has eyes..  That's right, it peers into the air to the
west at a small hovering tail-less rat.  It obviously wishes to speak
to the rat, by the expression it's giving, but..  It has no mouth.  To
the east a small dirt path travels through large puffy trees.

Surrounded by trees with a dark sky overhead, you travel a small
dirt path.  The trees on either side of the path are large, pink, and
fluffy.  Small three-legged creatures roam about here, peering at you
through dark eyes and matted fur.  To the west the edge of a large
ravine can be seen, while the entrance to a long, snaking building
lies to the north.

within a long snaking building that leads west and south.  Fluffy
little bunny rabbits and slimy slugs travel about, leaving cotton
balls or slimy trails in their wake.  A screaming child's echoing
voice can be heard clearly as the skylight overhead fills with the
light of a lightning strike.  To the south the building continues on,
while to the west the lobby is visible.  {9

from a stable tile to a mucky ooze from the snails that have passed
through here.  To the north the building's floor is more stable, while
to the east it snakes on through the sticky matter.  {9

down at a hard angle, while to the west it flattens out into a mucky
hallway.  {9
