A very large, very hungry crocodile looks your way.

The crocodile is covered with a tough horny hide, which blends in

that when the crocodile floats, only they remain above water, enabling
the beast to spot and ambush prey.  The crocodile is adept at floating
through the water and remaining quite still, presenting the illusion
that it is nothing more than a floating log.

catoblepas~
A Catoblepas~
A bizarre creature with bloodshot eyes tromps here.
~
The body of the catoblepas is like that of a large, bloated
buffalo, and its legs are stumpy, like those of a pygmy elephant or a
hippopotamus.  Its long, snakey tail is swift and strong, and can move
with blinding speed.  The head of the catoblepas is perched upon a
long, weak neck, and would be much like that of a warthog except that
the catoblepas is uglier.

You are standing at the base of a huge mountain.  Looking up
towards the top, you see more mountain, and way up at what appears to

Twenty feet or so from the ground, and only twenty feet or so
closer to the top.  There is very little vegetation visible on this
part of the mountain, but there is some up higher.  Closer inspection
reveals that there is what appears to be a message chiseled into the
mountainside.  It is a lengthy message and may reveal something of
interest.  To go up would be going up the mountain higher, and down
will do the opposite.

Woe be to those who would dare to travel this mountain.  A weakling
would surely perish from this adventure, and one who is strong.. 
Well..  It would really really hurt.  There have been rumors flying
about of a creature of great strength who roams this area.  'Tis true.
'Tis true.  I have seen it with my own eyes, a bird made of fire. 
That is the greatest of foes, though there is another that one should
not disregard.  There is a guardian ahead, who ensures those deemed
wise another that one should not disregard.  There is a guardian
ahead, who ensures those deemed wise enough pass, and others do not. 
I ventured there looking for the bird, and could not get past him.  My
sources told me I had to answer a riddle to get by him, thus, once I
came to him, he asked me what I wanted, I replied "I want a riddle" . 
He thought of one, and I said "The answer to your riddle is a tunic". 
Alas, for I was wrong.  He told me this, and disappeared from sight. 
Ne'er did I see him again.  Be warned now travelers, this is what is
ahead.  I leave this as a warning to those foolish enough to venture
forth.  Beware of the guardian of the forest, and the bird made of
fire.

specializing in exotic weaponry in the realms, and maybe a few
non-exotic.  Check out the products and buy something.

The Path to the Mountain~
~
The path to the mountain is very clear.  Just a well-trodden dirt
path with some shrubbery dotting the landscape.  Here and there are a
few rocks, but nothing life-threatening.  There is a building to the
east with a sign that says something about exotic weapons, it might be
worth looking at.  Other than that, the only other way to go is the
way you came and north.

an actual path of dirt leading the way.  The sounds of civilization

setting.

Stepping into the murky depths of the swamp is indeed a very
different experience than most would want.  Giant insects fill the air
along with the buzzing of their huge wings.  Fallen trees and rotting
logs litter the murky water all around, and the trees that are left
standing look like that are about to fall over as well.

The Swamps~
~
Stepping into the murky depths of the swamp is indeed a very
different experience than most would want.  Giant insects fill the air
along with the buzzing of their huge wings.  Fallen trees and rotting
logs litter the murky water all around, and the trees that are left
standing look like that are about to fall over as well.

Out of the Swamp~
~
Stepping out of the swamps feels good.  There are no more giant
bugs that want to have you for dinner, and then save you for lunch,
then a light snack.  There appears to be another pathway up ahead.

The Final Dimension~
~
As you stand here, you see the most elaborately decorated room you
have ever stepped foot in.  Tapestries hang from every wall depicting
many different scenes of battle, and just the usual forest scene. 
There is a rather interesting mosaic on the floor and a highly
detailed mural on the ceiling.  A large sofa sits in the northwest
corner of the room and looks to be very comfortable.  In the center of
the room there is a spherical object seemingly suspended in mid-air
with nothing holding it in place.  
~

E
south~
A forest spreads all across this tapestry.  There are a couple of
unicorns grazing, and a pegasus is sleeping peacefully in the
background.  There is a dark elf standing there talking to a woman who
is wearing what appears to be clothing of a ranger.  The odd thing is
that there is a {Ddrow {xon the surface.  You have heard a few tales
saying there was a {Rrenegade {Ddrow{x, and this only seems to heighten
those rumors.  
~
E
north~
On this particular tapestry, it shows a multitude of dark-skinned
elves in a large cavern which is, of course, underground.  Every
single {Ddrow {xhas either a weapon or two drawn, or is in the midst of
casting a spell.  On a ledge slightly above the mob of elves, there is
a huge hound standing next to a man.  The hound is about the size of a
draft horse, and is larger than the man.  The man is wearing a {Dblack
{xtunic and above his head there is a glowing skull surrounded by
something.  Upon closer inspection, the skull is {Dblack {xas well, and is
surounded by {rblood red {xdroplets.  The hound is bearing it's huge
fangs, and the man has a glowing {Rred {xsword in hand.  
~
E
west~
This tapestry here shows a man in a tan robe, facing whoever it is
that loomed this piece.  He is bearing an hourglass in his right hand,
and the sign of infinity is above his head.  Behind him, there is a
starburst of the purest white, and even on cloth, the colour is almost
blinding.  
~
E
east~
There is a tapestry on this wall depicting two scenes.  One shows
of a wizzened old man sitting in a transparent bubble smoking a pipe
reading a rather large volume.  Creatures of undefinable origin are
punching, kicking, trying to claw their way through the bubble to get
at the old man.  The other shows the very same man sitting at a table
across from a woman wearing a long flowing blue robe.  Above the
woman, there is a glowing symbol of eight stars.  The sign of {CMystra{x. 
It looks like the two of them are playing a game of dice.  
~
E
up~
Looking up reveals the heavens in all their glory.  Every
constellation can be seen, every falling star, every comet, every
meteor.  It is a sight to behold.  If only there were a way to capture
it.  
~
E
down~
A lovely mosaic of a very distiguished, very beautiful,
awe-inspiring bird.  It actually looks like the one you are looking
for.  The entire thing is made of {Rfire{x.
