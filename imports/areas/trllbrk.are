troll sentinel guard~
a {gtroll {csentinel{x~
A troll guard stands watch over the fort.
~
He's a nasty little troll, though as far as trolls go, he is
probably the pick of the litter.  He is lightly armored and is charged
with the task of guarding the outer moat--suggesting the other trolls
don't really like him very much.  When he's not at his post, he enjoys
causing trouble anywhere he can.

Trail off of Trade Way~
~
The trail fades into small brush and the brush into some trees as
you journey off Trade way.  The trees in this area are only about 3
meters tall but provide adequate shelter for the many rodents and
small creatures that scamper around your feet.

Trail into Trollbark Forest~
~
The tree level has risen greatly as the rodents and smaller
annimals have given way to the larger animals like the occasional deer
or bear.  On one of the trees a mark is carved that showing a fierce
warrior staring out deeper into the forest...  Maybe this forest is
inhabited.

Trail into Trollbark Forest~

he tree level has risen greatly as the rodents and smaller
annimals have given way to the larger animals like the occasional deer
or bear.  On one of the trees a mark is carved that showing a fierce
warrior staring out deeper into the forest...  Maybe this forest is

to such a holding unless a great debaclry occured. Although many of the
paintings and tapestries that hang on the wall have been ruined some are
still intact, meaning the trolls must have just acquired this fort.

These weapons might not be modern but you feel that them could cause
some damage if used by the correct person.  Could you be one of these

You are in the lowest floor and the main part of Fort Trollbark.
This hallway leads to the throne room that used to hide the king but
because this hallway is filled with trollish guards there is not a
human in sight.  You wonder why the trolls kept the artwork istead of
selling it as is usual troll custom and why they stayed in the castle
instead of destroying it.

A {yDirt Path {xoff the Main Road~
~
This dirt path has more recently been maintained by the City of Daggerford
as an official bypass through the city, mainly to combat the increasing
trends of traders hauling dangerous cargo, such as wild beasts and chaotic
magical items. The path is laid with fresh mud from the nearby river
and packed by the increasingly heavy traffic that this bypass sees. At
night when the city gates close, this path serves as the primary passthrough
for travelers north and south. To the west is the main road, while the
bypass continues to the east.

The dirt path continues here across sloping terrain. This part of the
path runs parallel to a large, wooden fence to the north. Upon closer
inspection, beyond the fence lies a treacherous ravine that separates
much of the City of Daggerford from the rest of the countryside, though
it is unclear whether or not this trench was natural, or made by mortal
hands, or perhaps the gods.

the vast countryside stretches into the distance. The path itself is
wide and well traveled, a testament to the necessity of the trade routes
in this region.

This dirt path is packed firmly with hardened clay meshed with smooth
pebbles from the nearby river. This technique was brought to this region
by the engineers of Waterdeep City, who needed to devise a cheap and
effective means of maintaining the trade routes that kept their city's
wealth. As clay is easy to find near the sea, it was a convenient choice
for paving the paths.

Crumbled clay from nearby digging pits is used to pave this path around
the city. It is easy to obtain, and nearby, making it an appropriate
choice. The only problem with clay is that when it gets wet, it becomes
slippery and dangerous to traverse, so road engineers added layers of
smooth river stones to the surface, and allowed the caravan traffic to
pack it down, effectively solving the problem. The path continues west
and south.

Veering east and west, the path follows the smooth winding contours of
the city walls, which lie directly west of here. Tall, wild grass grows
along the sides of the path and from patches of worn down holes across
it. Though thorny and unpleasant, the grass is vital to keeping the path
in tact, as the rainy season in this region is characterized by torrential
downpours and flash floods, which without the grass would quickly wash
away the path.

The sounds of city life carry over the wind down to this bypass path
around the eastern half of the city. Though faint and distant, the sounds
tell signs of another life lived within the walls, a fast paced existence
where adventure can find oneself at every shop and alley. Here, on the
other hand, is a solemn, purpose driven existence, where travel through
or around this area is necessary for maintaining one's way of life. 
Two worlds, divided by a wall, but no single one more important than
the other.

The winds cross in this region, kicking up strong gusts that for moments
at a time bring dust clouds and debris. From the east, the warmer air
rushes in and from the west, the cool sea breeze flows down the countryside
like a gentle stream. Together, they converge here on this solemn dirt
path that circumvents the City of Daggerford.
