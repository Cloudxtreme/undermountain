{8This unique breed of cat is special and specific to the Tripower Clan.
It's shifting form switches from jet black to any number of spotted
color combinations that range from simple black and white to complex
browns and tans that blend in with the cat's surroundings. This giant
cat stands over five feet tall when on all fours and has eyes that
shift color with its smooth fur, changing from brilliant blue to jet
black. Huge paws sport dangerous looking retractable claws. A long
thick tail sways gently behind the beast, seeming to have a mind of
its own.{x

of magic add to the wicked appearance of this glorious beast. The nose
of this Chocobo is covered in a thick blackened steel plating that
attaches to the beasts bridle. Lighter plates of metal form a mask that
covers the chocobos head, allowing spots on the top for long, smooth
black feathers to stick out. A black leather harness attaches to a well
crafted black leather saddle with stirrups. Glorious tail feathers
spread out behind the beast with streaks of bold blue and red, amongst
the jet black feathers. String but near useless wings lie flat against
this chocobos body, as black as the rest of the bird like creature.
Huge black talons dig into the ground and tri tipped feet rest the
beast comfortably but always at the ready.{x

Short smooth hair is cut in a neat boyish style and held back by
clips at the sides.  This female woman wears a long white apron
spotted with the occasional stain from today's food preparations.  A

chin.  She always wears a pleasant smile for her customers and a pair
of thin wire framed spectacles.

Three days after my twelfth birthday I acquired my first weapon of
mass destruction.  My sister, bless her soul bought me a pair of
beautiful scissors.  They gleamed so bright, their tips were so
sharp...  The curves of the handles were so elegant, I could feel my
pulse rising as I unwrapped them...  I was mesmerized by them.  I
remember running to my room and locking myself away for hours, simply
thinking of all the various possibilities...  I loved my sister for
that gift.  It was barely two weeks later that I snuck oh so quietly
into her room.  Our parents were away for the week, gone to Baldur's
Gate to sell some horses.  No one would hear if this got ugly. 
Something inside me thrilled at the thought of what 'ugly' might mean
but I kept it all under control.  I entered her room and let the
darkness settle over me.  I saw her form under the blanket, her hair
spread out on the pillow and I silently approached.  She stirred
slightly as I caressed her pillow but settled quickly.  I reached for
a lock of her hair and gave the first snip of the wondrous scissors. 
I remember feeling my breath catch as a shiver ran down my body,
hearing the blades come together as they cut anything for the very
first time.  
~
E
page2~
I remember trying to calm my breathing, thinking that she would
hear me, hear my thundering heart.  She stirred again and I took a
step back and it was like I was no longer there...  Like I was
watching through a dream.  I saw my sisters hand raise to me as she
called my name...  And I saw my own hand raise to take her by the
finger tips.  My other hand rose as well and cut her index finger off
with what seemed like such ease that it thrilled me even more. 
Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew my sister was screaming but I
still had her hand and I held fast to her jerking frame.  The
scissors...  They were red and silver now.  So pretty, those colors. 
I opened them with one hand and sliced them across her arm, watching
in amazement as her dark blood ran down her arm.  Pure elation ran
through my blood.  I gasped with pleasure and pulled her closer.  She
kicked and screamed and it drove me insane.  What was I doing?  I
couldn't focus on anything but this driving NEED.  Again my hand with
the scissors swept out, catching my sweet sister across her cheek,
slicing so deep it gave her this weird flapped smile that even in the
semi-dark of the early evening looked comical.  I remember hearing
laughter but it must have been in my head.  I pictured my sister
prancing like a ballerina with that smile.  
~
E
page3~
Oh the visions were so real...  Was it real?  Was my sister really
dancing in front of me with her new smile?  Smiling like she
appreciated what I was doing.  It came to me then, this was the
ultimate way of thanking her!  Of showing her my gratitude!  A surge
of strength came over me and I jerked her to me.  I embraced her fully
as she tried to dance in my arms.  I danced with her, traipsing all
over her bedroom.  We covered her woven carpet in our footsteps which
left beautiful red trails of our enjoyment.  We shouted our joy so
loud my throat was becoming hoarse!  Again and again I let her feel my
appreciation, sliding the blade of the scissors over her flesh. 
Across her stomach, cutting her night dress and making it turn that
sticky dark red.  Along her inner thigh, the blood there was so thick,
the cut so beautiful it was like nothing I had ever seen before. 
Across her breast, just lightly to match an emerging pattern that I
thought I saw.  Our dancing slowed, however as we both became tired. 
I could smell the passion we had just shared in the air, thick and
sweet.  I could taste it in my mouth, metallic and wonderful on my
tongue....  My eyes were shaded with a red curtain that ran into them.
Oh what a night!  We slowly sank into her rocking chair, me first and
she in my lap.  I gripped her tightly with one arm and pressed the
scissors against her flesh as she faded off to sleep, reminding her of
what brought us so close together.  Her beautiful gift that stirred my
very soul, a gift I could never repay her for.  I knew by the way she
stared into my eyes that she understood, her eyes so deep with
understanding...  
~
E
page4~
That was the last night I saw my sister.  My parents had come home
early having sold off all the horses.  When they saw my sister and I
they tore her from my arms.  Oh how they yelled and scream.  They were
jealous of what we had shared, I could tell.  They yelled for me to
leave, leave my sister and them.  I could tell my sister didn't want
me to go, how she just hung there with such sadness, her sad eyes
staring blankly at the wall...  All I could think of was how beautiful
her skin looked, so pale, streaked with dark red.  I remember reaching
out to touch her and my mother slapping my hand away angrily.  She had
been so cold to my touch.  I barely heard the angry words of my
parents as I picked up my scissors and left the room to pack my
belongings.  I didn't want to stay in this crazy house, where you
couldn't dance with your own sister!  They had never really understood
me anyways.  I would just go and find someone who did.  
~
E
page5~
That was the start of my journey, a journey that has led me to
today.  Today I start this diary so that someone, somewhere might
understand the joys and passion that I feel in my heart when they read
it.  When I went to the book shop to get this diary, I saw a young
girl of my sisters age on that fateful day and it sparked a hunger
inside of me to dance again.  It has been a long time since I have
imagined that kind of pleasure, and while there have been others that
I have enjoyed, and more weapons that I have used, there will never be
another like my sister all those years ago.  This girl, however...  I
have hopes she will be a fond memory.  I followed her and the mother. 
That silly mother left her child to play in the street.  She's here
with me now, her wide eyes staring at me as I write.  The anticipation
is so intense I can hardly contain myself.  I will wait until
nightfall and re-enact my last night with my sister.  Perhaps this
child will enjoy our dance as much as my sister had.  I can only
hope...

{8Briar Hall was funded by the Tripower Clan in response to the growing
number of orphans that could not find their families and grew up with
no where to go. The Tripower Clan decided to offer these children who
reached a certain age the opportunity to not only receive free
schooling, but also begin a regimen of military training that would
prepare them for the world, and for a position within the Tripower
Clan should they wish it at the end of their studies. They could be
scientists, soldiers, or many other things. The school takes children
as young as age ten and trains them until they are of age to join the
Tripower Forces.
{8
{8While Briar Hall takes outsiders who are in need, it's main focus is
on those coming from the Orphanages in the Tripower Kingdom. With hard
work and good teachers, Briar Hall strives to give these children a
true life, with opportunities they can look forward to expanding on.
{8
{8Briar Hall works closely with the Tripower Clan.

say Once the move is made you have a certian amount of time to copy the move.
say You can try to fake the move but chances are you'll be caught for not following properly.
say You need to do the actual move.
say If you fail the first competition you can always come back for the next.
