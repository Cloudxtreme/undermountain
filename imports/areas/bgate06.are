Duchal Palace Gateway~
~
Standing at the gateway causes one to stare in awe.  There are
pillars on either side standing tall and intricately carved with
designs that just boggle the mind with their sheer beauty and
perfection.  Not to mention that every few steps there is a miniature
mosaic on the floor. To the north is the palace itself.

Duchal Palace~
~
The palace itself is filled with wonderous carvings all over the
columns and walls.  The detail is so intricate it is amazing.  The
ceiling has a different mosaic every few feet as does the floor.  The
guards are standing at their posts ready to take action at the
slightest hint of trouble.

Guard Room~
~
This is a room where the guards are either cleaning or inspecting
their weapons and/or armor.  They are ready to spring to action if the
need arises.  Through the window you can see the Gateway.  It would
seem that is to give them notice if something happens.  There is a
ladder going up.

~
This is a rather large hallway.  The ceiling extends at least five
hundred feet up, and the pillars themselves are simply amazing.  The
carvings on them are so intricately detailed and so well-done, whoever
did them had to have the eyes of a hawk.

Dining Hall~
~
This is the dining hall.  There are very large and long tables here
with a lot of chairs as well.  At one table there are two rather
ornate chairs, one would assume that those are reserved for royalty. 
Suprisingly, there is very little food scraps laying about and no
rodents at all.  On the eastern wall there is a door.

Kitchen~
~
The royal kitchen is a royal mess.  Food is strewn about and flour
and sugar is all over the floor.  It would appear the either the cook
is messy or just in a rush.  It looks like it was done recently, so
maybe there wasn't time to get it cleaned up.

Before the Throne Room~
~
Here stands a great entrance way.  The doors appear to be made out
of solid silver, with highly detailed and intricate carvings no less
awe inspiring as before.  High above the doorway there is a stained
glass window depicting something that cannot quite be made out.  It
can only be assumed that this would be the way to the throne to the
royal family.

Throne Room~
~
Here is the great throne room of the royal family.  Against the
northern wall there sits the throne for the King and the Queen, and
there are a couple of smaller chairs.  It could be assumed that the
other chairs could be for the children of the King and Queen.  Guards
stand watch even when the royal family is not in here.  Were an
attempt to be made on someone's life, it would be difficult indeed. 
South is the only way out of the throne room.

Dungeon~
~
The dungeon is very disgusting and full of filth.  A few gnawed
bones lay about as if they were dragged by a rodent of some kind.  It
smells really gross and is very nauseating.  How anyone would be able
to breath this foul air and not vomit is a mystery in itself.  There
is a stairway to the west and cells are to the west, east and north.
