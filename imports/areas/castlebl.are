A walking spellbook is here, casting spells.

Old, but still in good condition, it's a walking spellbook!  Along the binding in
gold-leaf lettering is the name "Godsmith."  Some form of arcane text glows with
a brilliant color on the cover of the book.

the Decaying Root~
This long piece of decayed root seems more animated than the rest.

This 3-meter piece of root oozes and flows with dark energy.  A
dark grey in color, its sharp tip waves around wildly, warding off any
who would seek to examine it more closely.

lady teldra~
{xLady Teldra~
Lady Teldra is here, looking at you with kind eyes.
~
Lady Teldra, mistress of Lord Morrolan.  She is the head caretaker of
Castle Black and lover to Lord Morrolan.  She is very tall, over six feet,
and very slender.  Although she looks fragile, her body is very well toned
and has a nice muscular curvature to it.  Her ears are pointed, but with her
height and narrow face she would make an odd elf.  Then remembering some old
bard's tales, you realize that she is not an elf at all.  She is the last of
her race, known as Dragarians.  Dragarians are dragons who gave up their
life as a dragon by using their natural ability to polymorph and changing
themselves permanently into this humanoid form.

The master of Castle Black is here, donned in fine black robes.
~
The famed Lord Morrolan, the creater and master of Castle Black. The 
mere presence of this man causes the air around you to tremble. He 
wears his dark hair long and very nicely groomed.  Around his body
are black robes of soft velvetty cloth.  His eyes are a purple hue
which crackle like lightning and change to a deep red from time to
time.  At his side is a large halberd with the same words inscribed
on it as on the statue plaque, "Adjudicator".  A light hum comes
from the halberd.

than a centimeter each step.  She wears dark red robes made of silk
with a golden rope-belt around her waist.  Her hair is black with dark
green here and there.  She speaks with a thick accent you not familiar

Just looking at this gnome brings a chuckle.  This is the most
fashion-impaired gnome you have ever seen.  He wears bright red robes
with yellow stars all about and a tall pointy cap to match.  At the
top of his wizard hat is a gold star dangling from a wire that bobs
around when he walks.  In addition, little bells have been sewn to the
tips of his curly slippers, jingling with each step he takes.  A truly
comical sight!

being so dirty.  He wears a shirt that used to be white under a very
thick leather apron.  On the many loop holes on his apron, a hammer,
carving pick, and chisel hang, the tools he uses most often.  Although
only Grizwald's assistant, Roen is an established armorer and very

After travelling a while north, it seems you've found a break in
the forest.  The path you've been following leads to an opening,
through which blinding white light pours through it.  The light stings
your now-sensitive eyes and any attempt at shielding them short of
closing your eyes won't help.  The light seems to be comming from
every direction, especially the floor in front of you.  What could be
causing all this light?  Only one way to find out.

Light!  Blinding light!  It's everywhere, sparkling off every
surface for miles around.  Only in tales have you heard of this place,
but you never thought it actually existed.  Supposedly, this used to
be a vast desert.  When the residents of this place angered the God of
Destruction, he brought forth his wrath and melted the desert with
rivers of fire, boiling the sand and forever leaving it as a lifeless
plain of glass.  Thus it got its name, "The Glass Plains."  There
appears to still be spots where the sand is melted, pools of liquid
glass that looks as pure and clear as water, but hotter than the blood
of a fire elemental.  Through the blindingness, it appears others have
treaded this lifeless plain.  A path made of crushed and chipped glass
goes onward and appears to be the most solid of the plains.

A large shadow covers you, temporarily protecting you from the
blinding light and heat reflected from the sparkling ground. 
Positioning yourself right, you manage to keep the soothing shade on
you for a while longer and able to take in the fullness of the area
around you.  As far as you can see, what used to be dunes of sand,
windswept and full of desert life.  The dunes are no longer sand, they
are smooth, slick, mounds of glass.  In various parts of the glassy
dunes, gas pockets have shaped and moulded the glass into giant,
fragile bubbles.  The gasses swirl in entrancing motions and at times
the gas ignites, flaring up and illuminating the glass bubbles. 
Thousands of these bulbs (no doubt millions when considering the size
of a desert) flare up in what seems to be an orchestra of lights.  At
night, this place would be even more spectacular.  You doubt if Talos
had intended on creating such a beautiful display.

Without the shade, you would have blindly stepped over the edge.  A
giant stair- case leads down into a black chasm.  On the sides of the
chasm you can see various layers of color, starting with the clear
crystaline glass at the top then turning into a black obsidian.  The
staircase also follows this gradient, but this does not seem to be
your ordinary staircase; each step an easy three feet in height.  Who
or what uses this staircase is probably best left alone.  Your
pondering is broken when you notice the shadow is not created by a
cloud, but something far more marvelous.  What appears to be a giant,
inverted, floating mountain with the point facing the ground floats
above the end of the chasm.  A tiny structure can be seen atop the
flat surface, where a glint of light flashes off it.  Alas, a name
comes to mind, "Castle Black."  It is said by ancient bards that an
immortal lord by the name of Lord Morrolan lives there, protecting any
and all who enter his castle and politely ask for his protection.  No
fighting goes on within those walls, and those who break Lord
Morrolan's trust will know pain nearly rivaling that of Cyric.  He is
also the holder of one of three still existing Great Weapons.  With
the aid of a flight, one could possibly reach the castle.

The luminous shadow cast by the floating mountain still covers the
area, providing temporary relief.  Off in the distance you catch a
glint of light, a silvery stream of light that makes it way to the top
of the mountain.  It is impossible to make out exactly what it is, but
only distance will tell.  Then you notice a red haze down below in the
chasm.  It seems to waver like a wet cobble road on a hot day, as if a
red steam were rising out of the earth.  Could this be one of the
rivers of fire left over from Talos's rage?  The staircase continues
down a few more steps if you care to take a look, but even those few
steps is quite the hike.

You've reached the bottom of the staircase.  Here, the walls of the
chasm are solid black, seemingly made from pure obsidian.  Your own
reflection can be seen clearly off the many facets that glisten at
every angle from the wall and floor.  At this level, you notice a
definite change in temperature.  Instead of being cooler from being
out of the direct sun light and the reflective Plains, it actually
hotter and very humid.  The heat seems to be comming from the red haze
that glows in the distance.  Even more remarkably, you notice that is
absolutely no trace of dust or dirt where you stand, aside from the
dirt you brought with you.  It's almost as if someone is taking great
care in keeping this place clean and sparkling.

Moving closer to the wavy red haze, the heat is really starting to
pick up.  It's only a few hundred feet from you now, but it feels as
though every foot you take makes a difference.  Aside from the heat,
you can only marvel at the glassy walls of the ravine.  It's strange
how the glass has formed in this area, jutting outwards in every
direction like crystals.  Even the obsidian has taken on this
crystaline shape, making for a very strange albeit beautiful display. 
You've never seen glass or obsidian is these kinds of formations,
short of dwarven carvings and artwork.  Where you stand, the
formations are small or none at all.  They get larger and more
extravagant as you near what you presume to be the source of all the
heat.

Only some ten or fifteen meters from the heat source, the humidity
and heat in the ravine feels as though it has doubled, easily in the
hundreds.  Amidst the hazy redness, a black sliver can bee seen
splitting it through the middle.  You can no longer see the mountain
and resting place of Castle Black, nor can you see the silvery line
that leads to the floating fortress.  Steam and fumes surround you
now, making it difficult to much of anything.  Only the red glow in
front of you tells you you're going in the right--or wrong, depending
on your view of things--direction.

The breath from your lungs is stolen as you strain for breath.  A
raging river of fire pulses and burbles down below as it continues on
it's course towards the nearest body of water, releasing it's
tormentive heat wherever it goes.  A slab of black granite stretches
across the river of fire, consuming it and you in fumes and smoke.  It
would be possible to cross it, but you would have to go about it
quickly.  Out of the corner of your eye, you notice something stirring
below you in the lava.  Maybe it was only your imagination, for the
heat and fumes at this point are unbearable.

The fumes and heat have cleared mostly at this distance, and now
you can get quite a clear view of both the mountain and the silvery
glint leading to Castle Black.  The glinting appears to be some sort
of silvery line, touching the ground, then running up several hundred
feet to the edge of the mountain.  You're best guess as to what it
would be used for is a guide-line for those who wish to fly up to the
mountain.  In the distance, you can see something protruding from the
ground.  It has a long slender part at the bottom and a rectangular
section attached to the top.  Some indecipherable markings seem to be
painted on this thing, you guess it's unreadable due to the distance
from where you stand.  While thinking about it for a while, a word
finally comes to mind.  Ah, yes...  A sign.

The wind is relatively strong here, and the Silver Cord doesn't supply
very much assistance.  Looking farther up, though, you can see clouds racing
by, swirling and tumbling as they are tormented and beaten by the ferocious
wind.  The Silver Cord sways in the distance, but not by much for the cord
is stiff and strong as a rod of steel.  Down below you, some one hundred
feet or so, you can just barely see the sign you left behind.  If flying
abilities should fail at this height, it will be a long trip down to a short
death.  All in all, the cool wind feels good compared that treacherous heat.

From this height, you can clearly see where you are.  The apparent portal
you stepped through has taken you far across the continent and placed you
near the Sea of Swords.  It appears the Glass Plains were much like the
Sands of Sorrow at once point in history.  In fact, from what you can see,
the Sands of Sorrow are just to the north of you across a small body of
water.  To your southwest is an enormous forest, and farther to the west are
the mountains that ring the Elemental Canyon.  Almost swept off your guard,
the wind has really started to pick up.  A couple more hundred feet and you
will have reached the mountain.

Who would have thought one hundred feet would make all the difference. 
The wind is roaring past you as you hold onto the Silver Cord with a
death-like grip.  Even if you shouted at the top of your lungs, you still
wouldn't be able to hear your own voice.  Strangely enough, what trees you
are able to see that lay on top of the mountain are motionless, save for the
occasional light breeze.  It looks as though a permanent, yet localized,
control weather spell has been placed on the entire mountain.  The Lord
Morrolan must indeed be powerful to control such magic.  Indeed, to levitate
an entire mountain would require such a feat of magic you can only marvel at
the sheer power this man may hold.

Just before you reach the top, your legs dangle horizontally as the
wind rushes past you.  With your eyes watering you blinding pull
yourself up the Silver Cord.  Upon reaching the top, the wind suddenly
stops.  Silence.  Your ears are now in a constant ring from the wind
constantly rushing past your ears.  After a few brief moments, the
ringing begins to subside.  Another 10 feet and you'll be safely on
the edge of the mountain.  After taking a few minutes to catch your
breath and letting your ears take it easy, all that wind begins to
make perfect sense.  What better way to prevent an aerial assault on
your castle than to make it nearly impossible for any flying creature
to fly.  Even Tchazzar would not be able to navigate through these
winds.  Safe from ground troops and large flying critters, the only
people capable of an assault on Castle Black would be spell casters,
and from the magic it must have taken to make such a fortress as this,
any assault would be suicide.

Boy, it sure is a long way down.  Looks like you're over five
hundred feet in the air.  From time to time you catch a glimpse of 
the ground.  Clouds circle and swirl around mountain in a dazzling
display.  They look as if you had poured a dark oil into a bucket of
water, the way they move and twirl about.  Still, the clouds are 
white and relatively clear, allowing plenty of sunlight to reach the
topside.   Beneath your feet and running all the way to the dark
castle is a cobble stone walkway.  The sides are lined with a thick
fluffy moss, about a foot wide, which goes for about twenty feet or so
then curves around outwards forming a circle and meeting once again to
continue on a straight path.  In the center of the circle is a large
bronze statue, standing twelve feet in height.  It depicts a man in
long robes with matching long hair.  His eyes are cold and show no
feeling at all.  Both arms rest in front of him, his hand around a
mighty halberd.  Etched on the blade of the halberd is the word,
"Adjudicator."  A belt with a death lily carved on the buckle adorns
his waist.  At the base of the statue is a plaque.

The cobble stones on the path are maintained very well, glistening in the

illuminating the pathway.  At night, these reflective shells would seem to
enhance the moonlight and make the path visible.  Not far ahead you can see
a small orchard of trees, blooming with plump, juicy, delicious looking
fruits.  Oranges, lemons, and tangerines litter the ground, releasing a
sweet aroma into the air.  The cobble path goes right through the middle of

A definite sight.  Never have you seen fruit that large, save for those
grown in the Titan valleys.  The oranges are twice the size of a human fist,
the tangerines closely following, and lemons that make mellons jealous.  The
peels on the fruit offer no resistance and seem to simply fall off, inviting
you to indulge in its sweet flavour.  The lemons, if they could be called
that, taste as though the gods added a spoon of sugar into each lemon,
offering a sweet as well as sour feast for your taste buds.  This is a
remarkable orchard.

This tree is adorned with sour-sweet lemons.  The combination of flavours
is absolutely amazing.  You've never tasted a "sweet" lemon like this
before.  You wonder how the trees were changed to do this.  Perhaps it was
mixed with an orange tree; but then again it doesn't have the orange flavour
with it.  Somehow, though, these lemons have a sweet kick to them that makes
them quite tasty.  A ring of dark blue orchids surrounds this lemon tree.

A small bushel of white and yellow daisies occupy the base of the lemon

with the number and size of fruit these trees produce to supply an entire

so alive and fruitful.  No person could cultivate an orchard such as this

Bright orange poppies hug the trunk of the orange tree.  Oddly enough,
these poppies seem to have the same color as the oranges that grow above

much brighter orange to them.  Taking a quick sniff, the orange poppies even
smell a little like oranges.  It's probably due to the occasional orange
that falls to the ground.  One must of them must have landed and maybe even
leaked its juice over all these poppies.  Still, it's kind of strange.

Plump oranges hang over a group of white Gardinias, carefully placed
around the tree.  As an orange falls to the ground into the bunch of
flowers, a puff of glitter-like pollen shoots into the air.  It sparkles as
it falls back to the ground.  The wire fence begins again on this side, goes
for another two trees then heads south.

How many orange pickers does it take to pick an orange?  Well, from the
looks of these, at least four.  It would take an army to pick and carry all
of these oranges.  At the base of the tree are a group of vibrant pink
flowers.  Columbines it looks like.  A lemon tree is just to the east with a
tangerine tree shortly following.

Irisis of every different color occupy the ground here.  Lavender, pink,
and white, making for an extraordinary display.  Looking at the trunk of the
lemon tree, you notice that some of the irisis have found a rather nice home
on the tree.  Some of the moss that lines the pathway has grown on the tree
and made it stable enough for the irisis to plant themselves.  They have not
only grown on the trunk, but all over the tree.  They don't seem to be
hurting the tree at all, for it's still producing large and sour-sweet
lemons.

Although sweet, the air here doesn't seem quite as strong as other places
in the orchard.  The light breeze that seemed to be always constant has
almost stopped, only with the occasional very light gust.  There are some
lavender pansies that grow here, but they seem to rather wilted.  Why would
Lord Morrolan take so much care for his other trees, but not the ones on
this side?  Although the other lemon tree and the orange trees seem to be
growing fine, flourishing in fact, this one's lemons aren't quite as big or
smell quite as sweet.

Hydrangeas; an interesting name for a flower.  You wouldn't have even
guessed at the name of this flower if it weren't for the little flag
sticking out of the ground with its name on it.  It looks as though Lord
Morrolan is at least trying to take care of his orchard, but these flowers
look almost dead.  They look as though they were a deep blue at one time,
but now they are near to black and barely holding on.  The ground has been
freshly turned and watered, but they still don't seem to be doing well.

The sweet citrus aroma that was so pleasant does not exist here.  The
light breeze has stopped.  The tangerine tree is near dead and the dafadils
lay black and wasted at the base of the tree.  The tangerines on the tree
are withered, hard, and dried out.  What used to be soft grass that you
walked on throughout the orchard is now brown and dried out here.  Strangly
enough, the smell of death comes from the tree, instead of the sweet smell
of tangerines.

Made of pure obsidian or highly polished black marble, Castle Black looms
before you.  A stone archway with intricate angelic carvings stands between
you and the castle.  At a closer look, the carvings are not stationary but
swim along the surface of the archway as if it were made of water.  A rather
spooky addition to an already gloomy castle.  So far, this place doesn't
seem very inviting.

Massive black doors block the entrance, constructed of solid black
marble.  It looks as though the entire castle is also made of the same
material.  The cost to build such a castle would be incredible, more than
the entire Tri Power treasury.  It would seem that this Lord Morrolan is not
only powerful, in being able to levitate an entire mountain and control the
weather atop it, but incredibly rich as well.  The sounds of typical city
life can be heard through the doors.  A marble plaque hangs from the door:

You stand in the foyer of Castle Black, two elegant chairs are on either
side of you.  Between both chairs is a small table and a vase filled with
assorted flowers, you assume they are from the orchard.  The foyer it self
is fifteen feet by twenty feet, and not at all as dark and gloomy as you
thought it would be.  A chandelier blossoming with bright candles hangs
above you, keeping the foyer nice and bright.  Beyond the foyer, a long
staircase leads to a small marketplace held within the walls.  The staircase
is shallow and easygoing to accommodate for the various races that visit the
castle.  After twenty feet or so, there are two doors on the east and west
walls, both of which are covered in delicate silver drawings, as well as
what might be arcane runes.

Not far up the stairs some very beautiful paintings of two women hang the
walls.  Each has been painted on canvas with oil paints and extremely well
done.  One could easily mistake these paintings as if someone was looking at
you through a window.  Under each of the paintings is a name.  Under the one
on your left is the name "Sethra".  She has undeathly pale skin covered by a
silky white dress.  Her black hair is long and rests on the handles of her
jeweled throne.  Across her lap, she holds a dagger which burns with a blue
flame.  The other painting has the name "Cawti".  She looks to be a strong
human with a shapely body in tight leather.  Her auburn hair flails about in
the air as she wields a large two-handed sword and stares deep into your
soul with her green eyes.  Both women are extremely beautiful.  You wonder
if they were Morrolan's former consorts.

The two doors you saw earlier in the foyer ore on either side of you now.
The silver drawings on the doors are in fact some kind of magical runes. 
They glow with powerful magic, but this must be a long forgotten or foreign
art because these do not look anything like the common arcane language
spoken by spell casters.  Above the door on the left, carved into the stone
are the words, "His Lordship, Morrolan the Black".  Over the left door is
the picture of an open book with an ink bottle and quill next to it.  Two
more paintings are mounted on the walls a little ways more up the staircase.

This is the private sleeping chambers of the Lord Morrolan.  Ancient
books cover the walls, written in a strange language, perhaps the written
language of dragons.  The text is made of short strokes forming straight
lines and simple curves, but when put together the look like a complex
puzzle of lines and curves stacked together.  A simple yet elegant rose wood
bed sits in the corner.  Next to it is a small table with a single lit
candle.  The candle appears to be brand new, with no wax beads running down
the side.  Although only a single candle, it fills the entire room with
bright light.

small break for the door.  Two overstuffed chairs are in the center of the
room, faced at an angle to each other with a small coffee table between
them.  There are a couple desks behind the chairs, each with a pile of
paper, an ink blotter, and a quill.  Candle holders are clamped in place on
the sides of the tables for late night studiers.  During the daytime, this
room is filled with sunlight through the stained glass ceiling.  The stained
glass makes up a giant picture of the pale woman you saw in the hallway

The stairs have risen a total of around ten feet.  At the top of the
stairs there are two more paintings The painting on the left is a handsome
fellow in his late twenties or early thirties.  His expression is that of
caution, his black eyes wide open and his mouth slightly ajar.  What looks
to be a miniature gold dragon sits on his shoulder, its muzzle rested inside
the man's curly brown hair.  The young man wields a throwing knife, held in
his right hand, which is missing the pinkie.  A leather patch covers the
right side of his hand, looped round his ring finger and tied off at the
wrist.  On the right side of the hallway is the other painting, a picture of
a shapely woman in a silk outfit that outlines every part of her body.  It
looks as though she is attempting to sneak in this picture, wearing black
slippers as well as a fine black cloak around her body.  She has green eyes,
like that of the pale of woman, her facial features are very similar, but
with curly brown hair instead of the long, straight, black hair.  Underneath
the painting of the young man is the name "Taltos" and beneath the picture
of the woman is the name, "Kiera."

You stand before the marketplace of Castle Black.  The walkway has turned
from the smooth marble back to the cobblestone.  It's a small marketplace,
but then again it's inside a castle.  Considering the castles location and
the dark rumors often passed about Lord Morrolan, you doubt this place gets
much business and it's more for the comfort of the people who take temporary
residence here.  There is a large, cone-shaped fountain in the center,
glistening with crystalline water.  The hallway splits to the left and right
leading through the castle walls.  The cobble stone path goes onward into
the marketplace.

On this wall is a remarkable painting what you guess to be some sort of
spell caster performing a spell in front of a small golden dragon.  The
dragon looks like the one on the Taltos oil painting, as well as the mage
performing the spell.  The dragon is curled around an egg, and at the bottom
of the tapestry it says, "I offer it long life...  And I offer it my
friendship."  Beneath that, is a single italicized word, "Jhereg."  The
western entrance to the marketplace is south of you and the northwest
staircase is to the north.

A truly interesting place.  Aside from the trinkets and gadgets that are
strewn all over the place, something else catches your eye.  A complex
mechanism attached to the door turns and whirls, looking altogether very
impressive, only to ring a bell.  With all the "garbage" thrown about, it's
not a very good way to advertise a shop, until you notice who's behind the
short counter.  A very fashion-impaired gnome.

The sweet aroma of fresh baked bread fills your nose.  A very large chef
runs around the bakery gathering different items to make all his different
kinds of bread.  The room itself is filled with tons of bread: large loaves,
long loaves, loaves of bread made with peppers, some with cheese, some with
honey, and even one made with crab meat called "Waybread."  You never knew
bread could be made in so many different ways.

at you from the west.  From the looks of the display in the window, this
place must sell every type of bread you could think of.  To the east is the
Iron Forge Armory, which is one of two parts to the Iron Forge.  You'll find
the Iron Forge Weaponry on East Mainstreet, or you can go there through the

This building would be unbearably hot if it weren't for the two doors
that are always remain open.  A huge smelting furnace is in the back which
the armory and weaponry share accompanied by two large anvils and water
trough.  The walls of store are decorated by various pieces of armor, all 
of incredible make and design.  This part of the store is managed by Roen,

This wall has an interesting tapestry.  It is a picture of a swampy march
with the head of some sort of lizard-like creature.  It looks similar to an
alligator but has very smooth skin with blue swirls.  Its eyes are like that
of a cat and seem to glow slightly.  This tapestry is titled, "Iorich, the
Silent Hunter."  To the south is the east entrance to the marketplace and a

Similar to the Iorich tapestry, this one is a picture of a swampy area
covered with many lily pads.  On top of one of the lily pads is what looks
like a small furry mouse.  The feet of this mouse, however, or not clawed as
normal but are webbed and obviously made for swimming.  You don't recall
ever seeing or hearing of an aquatic mouse.  This tapestry is title, "Teckla
on a Lily Pad."

On this wall is another tapestry of a black cat, but this one lacking the
bat wings of the Tiassa.  This tapestry shows just how big the cat is, with
a woman leaning against the cat's side.  The back of the great cat probably
about five feet high, laying down.  You don't think you'd want to meet this
thing in the wild some place.  This tapestry is titled, "Dzur Lord."  If
that cat is a Dzur, then it definitely earns the title of "Lord."

The smell of salty air seems to come from this tapestry, as though you
were standing on the beach.  Looking at this tapestry is almost like looking
out of a window into the ocean.  Schools of fish, the sandy ocean bottom,
coral, and all sorts of marine life can be seen, but the tapestry seems to
be focusing on one marine animal in particular, the orca whale.  There are
two whales crisscrossing each other halfway in the air with a third coming
over head.  This spectacular scene displays the whales' agility and sheer
strength to heave it self out of the water, especially at that height.

This wall most definitely has the most incredible tapestry of them all. 
Opposite to the orca painting, a warm air radiates from this picture.  The
tapestry is a picture of a phoenix being born, rising from the ashes in all
its glory.  Flames whip about the phoenix as it raises its head towards the
sky and spreads its wings in the epic display of creation.  A most
incredible picture.  You could almost swear that the flames were actually
moving in this tapestry.  At the bottom of the tappestry it says, "And From
the Ashes Gray, I rise."

the center.  The man is raising his hands upward with a face of extreme
concentration.  From his forehead to the circle in the room are what look to

A bit larger than the courtyard out in front, the ground behind the castle
is occupied by a small crop.  The crop is divided into various sections.

rests between this door and the sixth guest room.  Two torches are on either

Through the window you can see a rather strange structure to the east of the
crop fields.  It looks to be a levitated fountain of sorts with no apparent
source for where the water is coming from.  From there, the water travels
down a small aqueduct to irrigate the fields.  With what you've seen so far,
you wouldn't be surprised if Lord Morrolan has devised a way to create a
permanent magical spring.

A dark, deathly feeling erupts from this place.  Somehow, you sense
that this is the origin of whatever killed this tree and is slowly
draining the life of the other nearby trees.  Any source of light
brought into this room seems to flicker and fade, as if it was being
drained by brute force.

As the source of decay shrivels, this place fills with a marvelous
white light.  Diffuse in nature, the light blurs the walls until they
seem to fade away.  A shimmering fog fills the area, and no one person
can see more than a few steps away.
