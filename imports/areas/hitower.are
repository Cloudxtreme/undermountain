Ezmerelda~
Ezmerelda the cook is here stirring a large pot of something.
~
Most people, regardless of race would consider this woman rather
ugly.  She has not one but six warts upon her crooked nose--at least
that's as many as you can be certain of, for some are hiding behind
others.  She wears a pointy hat, traditional headgear of brewing
witches, which in modern terms means old, outdated, and highly
unfashionable.  Her "dress" is dirtied rags which sweep the floor in
torn strips and doubles as her apron, smeared with all manner of
atrocities.  And her body....  Well, let's just stop there.  
{x
The good news is that her cooking is renoun the realms over for
being among the best ever.  It piques your curiosity.

Though his clothes are all in rags, you can see that at one time they must

casting you cannot tell.

He looks quite mad, no doubt he's been mistreated horribly.

for his line is of the late generation whose height was smited by the
gods.  He stands here next to a bookshelf, holding a book and reading
it as if there is nothing else but him and that text.  He wears the
classical robes of sorcery, of the old ways of the wizard's guild,
suggesting he is old himself.  Titans are oftentimes difficult to

He is skinny and frail, but tall and demanding, as titans can be. 
He is taller than many other titans, towering over seven feet in a
room that just barely fits his frame.  He wears the robes of a master,
though they are tattered and worn from years of wear.  Atop his head
is a pointy hat, a traditional accessory of many students of sorcery,
of which many titans are a part.  Though the High Tower takes many
students of many different races, it is the titans that are most
revered among the traditional, having earned the respect of having
patience and endurance for many magical arts.

To whom it may (or most likely may not) concern,
I am a titan scholar who currently resides and studies within the High Tower of
Sorcery.  My interests are of eastern mythology and history, particularly that
which pertains to the ancient kingdom of Cormanthyr.  I have entasked this
messenger with finding for me a scrivener who is skilled at copying books. The
scrivener must be able to read and write in the ancient titan tongue, for that
is how I choose to record my work, but for purpose of readability, must thus
translate my work to words that this messenger can read.  The messenger is
willing to pay a reasonable sum for the service, as it is his request that
such a copy be scribed.  My only interest in this matter is to aid this
adventurer in his search for knowledge pertaining to an old myth that is
centered around the ancient city of Myth Drannor, and so my thanks is given
along with his in this matter for any able to assist us.
 
Please respond at your earliest convenience,
Cordes the Scholar

{WThe Unbinding Ritual
{x
Paraphrased from the Tome of the Phaerimm, found in the ruined city by one calling
himself a "Knight of Myth Drannor".  Current status of the tome is unknown. It
was presumed lost in the ransacking of the Knight's encampment by trolls some years
after I read from it. Translated text is as follows:
{y
In balance, the Dark Lich sleeps, In chaos, the alliances are maintained,
Casted away, the fragments are apart, To bring them together, will awaken the Lich,
Twelve fragments, bound to twelve staffs, Held one in each hand, twelve bodies,
Standing together in the Necrotic Temple, One upon each of the twelve minor seals,
They stand as so: 
{y
Trace the compass as a clock, midday to midnight,
Three of pure good, north by northeast,
Three of neutral good, at first dip of the sun,
Three of neutral evil, in the wake of dusk,
And three of pure evil, in the slipping of night,
The thirteenth at the apex, the hinge and mid point,
Speaking the words of Unbinding,
To break the seal, these words are then said:
{y
{w     kuile druth daern  {y(awake druth daern)
{w      asta de ar auta  {y(arise and go forth)
{w       tessa au l ndor  {y(reclaim your realm)
{w        luma annon rusva  {y(the seal is broken)
{y
The Words to be spoken exact,
If one piece be out of place, then all shall fall.
{x

Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

oblivious to your presence.

Skylar's Hideout~
~
You are in a small, very messy room. An unmade bed is against one wall, and
books and papers cover every available flat surface. Empty beer cans lie here
and there, discarded with total abandon. A few over full ashtrays can be seen
on a desk.

Storage Room~
~
The room is well lighted, and the darkness goes away.  Before you
stands a huge storage room, filled with shelves and crates.  The
storage room seems to stretch on forever, into a deep cavern.  The
roof above you looks like nature rock.

say It was written that the Dark LIch lived in the ruins of Myth Drannor.

say The fragments scattered so that he could never be reborn.
