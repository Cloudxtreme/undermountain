What a nightmare!  The ship has crashed upon this devilish island. 
I have been so busy trying to stay alive I had forgot about my diary. 
This place is plagued by some curse.  There are werewolves that plague
all the inhabitants that have had the misfortune of crashing here. 
There is a small town near the center of the island where people have
begun to settle in.  It appears there is no way off the island. 
Oleilas's has made many attempts to magically travel off the island
but with no success.  The town elder says there is a map or a logbook
of some sorts somewhere that will aid us all with leaving the island. 
But it is just to dangerous to continue looking for it.  We have all
tried to form groups and search but the werewolves are just too many
and too great a threat.  Many have died and there isn't that many of
us left.  The town seems to be secure but Oleilas has a feeling that
someone on the island isn't who they say they are.  We have setup the
old ship as a safe haven and a place to barricade ourselves from those
damn werewolves.  Neither of us wish to continue risking our lives
since we still have each other.

The weather is horrible!  The ship is tossing to and fore
constantly.  I have been stricken to my bed due to sea sickness.  I
have never seen such storms as this...  Very awkward indeed.  I had
asked one of the ship hands about the weather and storms and he became
very hush hush.  I keep getting that sense that something is not right
about this trip.  I hope this trip is over soon.  *PUKE* I can't take
much more of this.  Oh, I just heard someone yell, "Land Hoe!"  . 
Finally!

After many adventures and many journeys Oleilas and I have decided
to settle down.  We are going to embark on the journey that is the
rest of our lives together.  Huzzah!  We will be boarding the ship
soon that is to take us to our new home.  As much as I hate water I
crumbled to Oleilas's begging that we take the ship instead of the
long walk.  It is better to take the quick route anyway as I can't
wait to be wed.

Imako and I made our way to the village again for a meeting with
the Elder.  We have all nearly given up on getting off the island but
he still offers hope.  After many attempts though that map or logbook
seems that it may be lost forever.  He suggests that we venture to the
old ship wreck north of town on the furtherest beach.  But I know it
is a suicide mission.  There are too many werewolves and the further
north we go the more powerful they become.  Gheroin has offered to
make a weapon that may give us the advantage over the werewolves.  But
he said we would first need the fangs of the werewolves.  When I
inquired, "What can you make with fangs?"  He seemed to not want to
answer me in front of the Elder.  
~

page2~
The longer I am here the more paranoid I become.  There is someone
here on the island that doesn't reside in the town.  Imako also senses
them.  When we do take trips to town we can both feel the presence of
some magical being beyond the werewolves.  The towns people have begun
to coop very well with the situation at hand.  Especially Gheroin.  He
is quite the resourceful one when it comes to the werewolves.  I visit
him often as he has taken a liking to me, mainly because I am a
priest.  He is able to make a very strong and magical bonding thread
from the guts of the werewolves.  In fact my feet may have froze off
if it wasn't for him.

This island is indeed cursed!  I have started a journal to attempt
to figure out a way off the island.  Transporting magically isn't
going to work.  And the last group that attempted to leave via a boat
just ended up back on the island amongst a hoard of werewolves.  There
are quite the few characters here though.  It would almost seem that
each person has a reason of some sorts for being here.  As if someone
was recruiting them for their own needs.  Imako is very worried and I
do the best I can to calm them.  We have given up on trying to search
for the map or whatever it is the Elder is looking for.  I can't help
but find myself becoming more and more paranoid about the people here,
except Gheroin.

A new group of people have washed up on shore.  Eager bunch they
are.  A group of novice explorers.  They are danergously naive.  They
had asked our group to join up with there group in a rather rude way
the first time.  "Join with us!"  They nearly demanded.  Bah!  They
will get us killed if we do.  They are unaware of the danger that
lurks here.  If the werewolves don't eat you something else may get
you and do far worse things.  After they had done some searching and
some dieing they had nearly begged us to acompany them.  "Embark with
me."  , their leader had pleaded with me.  As much as I want off this
island I'm not ready to die so quickly.  Argh!  This journal pisses me
off.  
~
E
diary~
As per Oleilas's request I have started this journal.  I don't see
the reason in it because I never forget anything.  Though the
suspicion that there is a greater force at work here is not invalid at
all.  I know there a mage of some sorts hiding here.  While I was
investigating the island earlier I had found portals leading to
certain parts of the island.  I know neither Oleilas or me had made
them since our magic is deemed null here.  Though I don't believe it
is someone in the village but someone else who doesn't visit the
village anymore.  The Elder knows more than he is letting on to us. 
When I asked him about this mage or wizard he became very hush. 
Oleilas and Imako think these journals will help us figure out this
conundrum.  Bah!  I can't stand this journal.

{yA Wrecked Boat - Entrance{x~
~
From here, the tossing sea continues to churn, revealing the wreckage
of various other ships.  This vessel, an amazingly huge ship, is upright 
in the sand despite the aft third of the ship being broken off.  It
appears that repairs have been made, although not to fix the ship's
seaworthiness, but to seal off the elements and make it more like a home.
Around the makeshift door are claw marks and what appears to be blood,
long dried in the sun.

{yA Wrecked Boat - Entryway{x~
~
This entryway looks like a war zone... the walls have been hacked
and clawed, and it's obvious that there have been arrows fired at
the door from what looks to be a very fortified area.  There are only
two places to go... forward into the ship, or outside.

{yA Wrecked Boat - Main Room{x~
~
This room is what appears to have been a cargo area, but it has been
redesigned.  Now, it resembles a living room of a house, save one that
is in the home of someone with an obsession with furs... a soft carpet
of fur is underfoot, leading to some fur-covered couches, doubtless
stuffed with yet more fur.  There is some beautiful art nailed to the
walls, all in natural colors... most likely made with natural dyes and
the like.  To the north is what appears to be a kitchen, while to the
east and west are stairs.

This is a very magically modified kitchen, with a cooking flame that
somehow creates no heat, and yet still manages to cook food.  Berrels
of salt are piled in a corner, and a good deal of salted meat is being
prepared right now.  There is very little food here that isn't made of
meat... and it looks to be strange meat.

The floor shows wear from heavy traffic.  Some of the planks have
been recently replaced and are of a different type of wood from the
rest.  Though the craftsmanship is near perfect.  Chatter can be heard
coming from the rooms both north and south.  There is a smell of mixed
musk and freshness coming from the south.

The healing room consists of enchanted mattresses that heal the wounds
of those resting on them at an unusually fast pace.  Several of them 
show faint bloodstains, which make it evident that they were a wise
addition to the ship.

This room is much like the main room of the ship-house, except instead
of pictures on the wall quivers and quivers of arrows are hung, along
with bows and spears.  Along one wall of the chamber is a line of what
look to be mattresses, each with a blanket folded and placed on top.
Along another wall, boxes that smell strongly of salt and meat rest upon
each other, barrels of water lined in front of them.  North from here is
what seems to be a mage's study room, and to the east is a room, filled
with medical supplies.  South appears to be more storage space.

Runes line the walls and floor of this room, exuding magical power.
A meditation mat, with symbols drawn in blood upon it, sits in the
center of the room, and seems to focus the energy... apparantly, this
room was designed to help mages memorize their spells more quickly,
and to provide a focus for priests to regain their god-granted spells.

various sized test tubes with strange liquids within them.  The

The wall near the table also has portions that appear to have been

The ocean laps at your feet as you stand on this beach, gazing
around at all the wreckage that has been washed up on shore.  Several
ships seem to have been wrecked here, and they appear to have been
torn apart for lumber.  To the west is a a large ship-house, and to
the east you can travel further along the beach.

There are several lifeboats pulled up along this beautiful beach. 
They are doubtless too weak to withstand the storms that you would
face at sea, so they are most likely useless.  However, two of them
are filled to the brim with what appears to be human and animal bones,
most of them broken open.  From here you can travel up the beach to
the north, or go west to approach a large ship-house.

The sand is beginning to thin here, mixing with rocks and a small
amount of growing plants, Looking north you can see a flat plain, and
to the west of the plain is a beautiful forest.  Scattered along this
part of the beach is the occasional cleaned and cracked bone, left
over from some animal feeding.  To the east you can see the start of a
path through the plains, and to the south is more beach.

The sand gives way here to a grassy field, which stretches to the

tell whether it was made by animal or man.  You can follow the path to

You stand further into the plains, and as you glance around, you

the beach again.

The room has makeshift wooden floors that are covered in paint. 
Paintings line the walls and the edges of the room.  The paintings are
beautifully executed pictures of the local scenery.  A small easel

The room has makeshift wooden floors and is loosely constructed out
of large logs.  Various materials lay littered about the room. 
Baskets full of wolf's fur and cured leathers lay about the room.  A
small loom rests in the corner of the room with a strange shiny thread
within it.

This room is small and damp.  A small amount of light shines
through the floor boards above.  The walls are thick with mud and
roots.  A slight whimpering sound can be heard coming from the north. 
The ground has deep score marks in it as if something heavy was
dragged through here.

The ground isn't so muddy here.  Two large solid iron doors are on
either side of the hallway.  The whimpering sound has become louder
and appears to be coming from behind the iron doors.  The deep score
marks in the ground continue here and further north into the tunnel. 
The doors are rather rusted and a foul stench slithers out from under
them.

Two more solid iron doors rest on each side of the tunnel here. 
They are as rusted as the others.  The stench can still be smelled
here but it is combining with a chemical smell that seems to be coming
from one of the three doors here.  The door to the north is different
than the others.  It appears to be made of a stone material.  The deep
score marks in the ground stop here.

The room is a hole dug from the earth.  Vines and roots protrude
from the walls.  The room appears to have been dug by some large
animal as the walls are littered with claw marks.  The ground has paw
prints everywhere, seemingly stacked atop of each other.  The only
other visible markings is a drag mark leading from the door to the
vault.

The room is filled with instruments and vials.  Two large tables
rest facing each other with small and large pieces of equipment used
in experiments.  A smell of burning and rotting flesh is stagant
within the room.  In one corner of the room a large pile of black ash
rests with small chunks of bone protruding from it.

The room is amazingly neat and furnished compared to the other
rooms.  Large stacks of ancient tomes lie about the room, some nearly
reaching the ceiling.  A single chair rests towards the back of the
room.  Parchments and large scrolls hang from the wall with what would
appear to be gibberish to a normal person.

shows signs of a large fight but no blood can be seen anywhere.  The
