{B     1{x:  {cIf you have problems with an mprog or have questions, do NOT hesitate to
{c         ask your head builder(level 108), OR a Lead Builder(level 106).  These
{c         people have good experience with the building process up to and including
{c         mprogs, and likely have the answers or solutions you are looking for.
{x
{B     2{x:  {cALWAYS name your mprogs.  This is important becuase more than likely you
{c         will not always be a builder.  As a person following up on a person's

{c         choose to not assign a damage type or have it show.  However, now they

introduction~
{RI{rntroduction{x:
{c
{c Have you ever come accross a mob that addresses you by name?  This and
most things that mobs do in the presence of players is the result of a
mobile program, from this point forward called "mprog".  Mprog's can
perform many complex functions depending on the skill and patience of
the builder.  You can add additional "skills" to mobs with assigned
damage that a mob normally would not have.  You can use a mob to trade
in items for other items.  THe possibilities are endless.
{c
 The following pages will detail the different parts and construction of
the mprog as well as providing several examples of how they work together.
The biggest trick to building mprogs is trial and error when trying
something new.  Do not be afraid of mprogs, they will not break the mud
and should a crash occur and you think it may be related to your work,
feel free to contact the head builder or an implimentor.{x
