This is Bronson, an enormous red dragon whose main talents lay in
that of inflicting pain on his enemys.  His freshly sharpened fangs
and claws gleam menacingly at you in the eerie light of this arcane
lit room.  His mouth opens wide as he sees you and his scales seem to
glow even more red, to the color of blood even.  If you wish to train
your skills Bronson would be happy to help.

Golden scales shine in the light from the skylight windows.  He has
a small wispy dragon beard, and his claws are just abit shorter than
others of his kind, indicating age.  A book instructing one how to do
something is held in one of his claws, and in the other he has a pipe,
very odd thing that dragons like to smoke.

Before you stands a creature much like a dragon.  Its wing span
spans that of a titan's height and its proud flaming eyes stare down
at you.  Staring back at you, instead of the eyes of an intelligent
dragon, are the eyes of a puppy dog or a pet of some sort.  The wyvern
licks you with its long forked tongue and points with a bone claw to
the sign on her neck.

Could this person truely be a leader of the esteemed

complete with white hat, he holds several milk bottles
in his hand while trying to find the houses to deliver
them to.  As he nears you, the shaft of a spear slung
across his back becomes evident.  Perhaps this friendly
looking milkman has a lust for battle after all.  Not
one to be afarid of defending himself, Samwise quickly
draws his spear and grins as he takes drink of milk
while his soul ignites with the burning desire to fight.

Clanning Proccess of The Hoard
------------------------------
 
1.  An applicant posts a full RP application to DHM
2.  Two ranked members (can be B, P, or L), must step
{x    forward and sponser the applicant
3.  Once two sponsers have steped forward, the applicant
{x    will be interviewed whenever the applicant can and
{x    there are 3 DHM members on who have the time.
4.  One person at the interview (generally a sponser)
{x    will log the interview and then post a copy of the
{x    log to the clan.
5.  Voting will then be open until no vote has been recieved
{x    for 24 hours.  Votes can either be Yes, No, or Neutral and
{x    the votes should be posted to ONLY the leaders with a short
{x    explanation of why you are voting the way you are.  Once
{x    your vote has been counted, you will recieve a confirmation
{x    so that you can remove your forum note (so the board doesn't
{x    get cluttered).
6.  If the voting ends in a favorable fashion, the applicant will
{x    be given a quest from either the sponser, or another clannie
{x    who has agreed to do so and talked to the sponser about it.
{x    The quest should be mutliple parts testing various things.  The
{x    applicant can ask for help on IC channels in an IC manner only.
{x    DHMers and their alts are not allowed to give help however the
{x    person who administers is allowed to give 2 hints per section.
7.  The person passes the quests, they are clanned.

set aside for parties and reclining.  {^C{6ushions {*and chairs made from

specifically for comfort.  In the middle of the circle is a tray
filled with refreshments to suit any palate, including that of the

area.  {7M{&a{6r{&b{7l{6e {xbenches line the walls while grass grows magically
beside them.  Beds of flowers add a sensation of life to what would be
a rather dull room.  A strong and muscular tree stands in the center
of this room protruding through the glass celing.  Birds have built a
nest in this tree and sing naturally as if they have no care in the
world.

{#G{3old{x, {7s{&ilver{x, and {7pl{&at{7in{&um{x are stacked up high in this room. 
This is the place that the Dragon's Hoard stocks all of its riches,
from golden goblets to jeweled crowns its all here.  The walls are
filled with priceless paintings, either stolen or bought from other
rich merchants from around the realms.  The floor cannot be seen,
because the massive ammounts of treasure cover it completely. 
Standing in the middle of the room is a huge {7w{&hit{7e d{&r{7a{&go{7n{x who seems to
be hoarding the treasure around himself.  Since the dragon's hoard are
merchants, it seems even in their ranks everything is not free, so
this dragon sells off some of the less valuable treasure to its
members, for low prices.

{2This room, small and smelling of bird shit, is large enough for
only three or four people.  Such a room belongs to a solitari pigeon
who struts about with great intent.  Of course, this pigeon cannot fly
with great intent because he's featherless.  His feathers, white and
grey, are in a nice neat pile in one corner of the room, mocking him.

you breath is thick with the smells of acrid smoke

black dragon with its head looming high above yours.  On his arm, his
master has tattooed him with the sign of {BThe D{bragon's H{Board{x.  Standing
behind Bahamut stand the etched platinum doors to the leaders only
office where the fate of this great clan is decided.  The floor fills
this room.  Many tapestries hang around this room, depicting leaders

The room is filled with a mist, seemingly coming out of nowhere. 
At first you stare into it thinking it is fog, but as you slowly enter
the room, you can tell its more than that by the sweet intoxicating
lovely smell of high quality WEEDDDDDDDDD.  As you around you notice
the many beautiful women holding Mac 40 oz.  Of mickeys and other high
high high HIGH quality alcoholic beverages.  On the wall you can see
Andales brewin up some tequila sunrises, and erebus rolling up a fatty
in eager anticipation.  On the table there are 100 dollar bills and
mounds of platinum collected by samwise's pimping of hoes, and next to
them, you see a box full of multi colored pills, various uppers
downers, shrooms weed, lsd, E and other {-H{-a{-P{-p{-Y{x piLls.  As you look to
the left you see a small kitchen housing the CoP's cooking equiptment,
all of them being fine trade chefs.  To the right you can see bottles
of expensive liquor and other items for illing.  On the wall you see a
small poster, stating the rules.  You must like, Drinking, Smoking
Weed, and other forms of ill shit.  This place is the fucking bomb yo.

Seconds here feel like minutes.  Reality is {^p{6ha{*s{6ed {*so that moving
objects leave trails as if in slow motion.  It is all based on
perception, time is not really slower in this room, but the esence of
time has slowed conciderably.  A large {&l{7um{&i{7n{&es{7ce{&nt {*clock face makes up
the whole north wall as the second hand ticks ever so slowly.  The
room has a pale beige tinge to it being illuminated off of the giant
clock face.  Directly opposite the clock sits a solitary wooden chair
along the center of the south wall, facing the ever ticking hands.  A
euphoric sense permeates the room as you desire just to sit and watch
the clock...

The room is rather large you notice. Tapestries hang from the
walls depicting dragons of every color and race. A large {Dst{won{We {wde{Dsk{x
sits in the center of the room and emblazoned on the front of it
in bright burning {wsil{Wver ru{wnes{x is the mark of {BT{bhe {BH{board{x. A simple
{ywooden chair{x sits behind it and as you look you notice no other
chairs in the room. You are expected to stand as you are interviewed
Above the desk mounted on the wall is a huge {Rdr{rag{Ron {Wskull{x.
Around the room in every corner you see suits of armor forged from
the brightest elven steel or crafted from shining dwarven mitril.
Large cabinets line the walls displaying a wealth of magical items
and unknown books of power sit on soft silken cushions inside.
If this is only the recruiting office, what other treasures might
{BT{bhe {BH{board{x possess? What wonders might you see in the deepest parts
of the fortified keep that is home to {BThe D{bragon's H{Board{x.

As soon as you enter the room, it starts to change into its
form from some other time.  Here, time has no static meaning.
All the sounds you hear are muffeled as your are being thrust
between different time periods over and over.  Off to the side
you can see the faint purple clouds asuring you that you are
still in the fabrics of time.  The only thing that is staying
the same is a small rift in the fibers to the south which
seem to lead to one time period which seems to stand still.
