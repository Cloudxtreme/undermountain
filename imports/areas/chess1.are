Black Square~
~
Obscure darkness overlays the room as you enter.  Perched along the four
corners of the room lies a small torch, each giving off some sense of relief
from absolute darkness.  The surface under your feet is made of a strange
black hardened marble as you also notice several blotches of blood recumbent
around you.  Distant battle-cries and shrieks of death can be heard from
around leaving you somewhat hesitated as you wield your weapon tightly and
become more aware of your surroundings.  To leave the chessboard, you can go
west where the Market Square is seen.

Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts lie
about here along with plattering marks of blood along the white walls and
the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total balckness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts lie
about here along with plattering marks of blood along the white walls and
the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total blackness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

corners of the room lies a small torch, each giving off some sense of relief
from absolute darkness.  The surface under your feet is made of a strange
black hardened marble as you notice several blotches of blood recumbent
around you.  Distant battle-cries and shrieks of death can be heard around
leaving you somewhat hesitated as you wield your weapon lightly and become
more aware of your surroundings.

Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts lie

and the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total blackness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

corners of the room lies a small torch, each giving off some sense of relief
from absolute darkness.  The surface under your feet is made of a strange
black hardened marble as you notice several blotches of blood recumbent
around you.  Distant battle-cries and shrieks of death can be heard around
leaving you somewhat hesitated as you wield your weapon lightly and become
more aware of your surroundings.

White Square~
~
Although the brightness of this room leaves you with some relief, it also
silences the noise into a shivering nothingness.  Decapitated body parts lie
about here along with splattering marks of blood along the white walls and
the hard white marbled floor.  Corridors into the other rooms lead into
total blackness as your heart beats rapidly wondering what you'd encounter
next.

Descent to~
~
The room temperature suddenly intensifies as pitch blackness dominates
your eyes.  Strange demonic figures hang around you almost looking
lifelike..  Or is it?  Several rotting carcasses burn along the room here
giving a horrible smell in the room.  Distant cackles can be heard along the
walls.  Bright fire can be felt as you scan below you.  This is the only way
out.  A NEWLY MADE IMMORTAL SIGN IS HERE FOR YOU TO READ!

To all of you who rish fighting in here:
 
Please be aware that mobs here are beyond the levels of 110 and may cast 
spells that are beyond mortal powers to cure, some namely as poison, fire
breath, blindness, etc., For the price of getting good EQ from here, I have
purposely given spells to these mobs to balance out the process in making
combat tougher.  If you disagree with this, I suggest that you not fight here.
 
Thank You.

Strange Setting~
~
A golden chandelier hangs above the central part of the room.  Strange
mosaic paintings of priests casting spells on hideous monsters furnish the
eastern and western walls here.  The stone surface of the walls and the
ground give it a cave-like atmosphere.  In between the paintings are some
very odd-looking weapons that hang as a use of decoration to give the room a
much pleasant sight.  However, you find the room to be somewhat strange.  A
humongous tapestry with a dragon and a demon is drawn lying on the middle of
the room.  A huge crystal altar with several demonic statues stand aside.  A
strange tiny furnace of blue fire illuminates the front end of the room.  A
small table to provide an altar in worshipping the holy..  Or unholy.  The
room is covered partially with dead carcasses being flamed into bits of
smoldering ashes.  You gasp..  And realize you should leave here.  A rope
leads you out of here into the darkness.  A strange shaft with scorching
flames continue to brighten even more to the bottom.

Dark Room~
~
Strange wails of evil laughter and moans haunt the room as you enter. 
Several broken tombstones lie about here.  The room is bare, layered only
with stone bricks to provide itself standing around here.  Some badly
rotting away and almost cracked into different bits.  You notice several
pieces of it falling from the ceiling above as if something upon is giving
way to something heavy.  A eerie mist floats about here terrorizing you! 
Several piles of decaying bones lie scattered about here..  Almost like a
cemetary of sorts.  You stand paralyzed!  A strange fire is seen below.  A
rope takes you back up to the hot intense heat..  But do you dare try to
climb again?

Before the Gates of Hell~
~
The entire northern wall has been replaced by huge black iron gates! 
Beyond the gates is nothing but flames rising high above the ceiling!  Death
is before you!!  As you look behind, you notice several devilish-looking
guards glaring at you as you enter here!  Exits either move up or north into
HELL!

High in the Skies~
~
The skies lighten cheerfully as a slight breeze flows about here. 
Several cumulus clouds loom here and there but nothing obscure.  Several
birds fly across squwaking in a distance.  A feeling of pleasure and ease is
felt as you ascend here.  A brighter stream of light shines as you gaze your
eyes upward.  Far below you, the chessboard can be seen standing high next
to Westbridge.  AN IMMORTAL-MADE SIGN IS HERE FOR YOU TO READ!

Golden Lit Sanctuary in the Skies~
~
As you climb higher upward, the beaming skies emit a dazzling sight. 
Solid clouds furnish the ability to walk as you trot along the path here. 
Across the east and west of you are colorful glossy windows, each displaying
holy figures of the sacred church.  Holy-engraved banners hang about here as
you wander through this huge outdoor sanctuary.  At the front, a long marble
altar rests with an emblazoned cross in the center.  Statues of holy gods
furnish the background as well as chorus-filled chants illuminating the
lit-up skies.  Several doves scurry here and there as magnificent white
clouds rise high above the giant sanctuary.  Beneath you is a path headed
down to the lands of Waterdeep.  Above you lies a golden ray of ..  Check it
out.

Peaceful Path Along the Clouds~
~
With clouds beneath you feet for easy movement, your eyes widen at the
beautiful golden rays that shoot forth everywhere.  Golden statues of angels
and prophets stand along the clouds in a monumental way.  As you scan
around, you notice a strange sensation fill within your body.  
 
A heavenly voice chants, 'FILL WITHIN THE SPIRIT MY CHILD..'
 
A sanctuary stands far below.  From a distance, you see huge gates above.

Before the Gates of Heaven~
~
Throughout life, talks of heaven and angels and the One have aroused your
curiousity.  As you stand here, the sun glows even brighter than before and
the huge gates before you, is the only thing that prevents yourself and a
life of eternity!  Two guardian angels stand guard beside the gates
approving of those who have chosen to walk in the Light.  Chants of angels
are loudly heard in unison as a harmonious chorus of singing is felt around.
Beyond the gates lies heaven..  And from a distant, you make out a gigantic
throne where possibly the high deity is seated.  Entrance lies to the north
into the gates.  Below you is the quiet realms of the clouds.

Prepare to Die!~
~
Welcome to your end!  Hell is upon you!  All you can see is blinding
fiery flames rise all the way above you..  Towering upon your mere mortal
presence!  Smoldering coals provide the surface underneath your feet.. 
Flaming on your poorly-made boots.  There is no escape!  You will die!  As
you wander about here..  You trip over a strange knob of some sort.

Heaven!~

"Paradise is bliss!  Eternal life is given to those who've travelled in
the Light of day.  Those who have travelled in the darkness may bow down and
repent!  Sinners who refuse to serve the Almighty shall perish in the hands
of the Supreme Being!"  
 
The thunderous voice faintly stops, as a swarm of people from all walks of life 
gather about here repenting, praying or praising waiting for the Judgment to 
come down upon them.  A blasting beam of light blinds you making visibility
somewhat impaired.  To the south you exit heaven forever!  How will the Almighty
judge you?

Top of the Tower~

You are now standing at the top of the tower where high above you is the
roof with a chandelier--*broken* hanging above you.  Windows can be seen to
your east where distant cumulus clouds flounder about the skies.  A flight
of stairs makes its descent behind you.  The room itself has nothing but a
strange circular carpet on the floor with the face of a certain warrior in
full-clad uniform.

beside you.  As you scan outside the tower, you see nothing but the sky
informing you that you've climbed much much higher now.  Possible exits go
up and down the stairs.

As you make your way up this deathly quiet tower, several uncovered
windows can be seen looking outward towards Miden'nir into the thick green
forest.  Westbridge can be seen distantly at the far northeast.  Several
cobwebs build around you but nothing threatening.  The stairs continue up
and down.

designed only to ascend upwards providing not much movement in here to move
around.  The only thing visible is a long stairway that takes you up into.. 
Somewhere.  The only possible exit is out east into the thick forest.

your feet is made of hard solid wood with a tiny latch visible to it.  Hmmm
try going down..  Or back up if you choose.
