The {wB{8lack {wK{8night {xstands here vigilantly awaiting his next battle.
~
{8The B{wlack {8K{wnight {8stands here ready to fight to the death.
The eye slits of his helmet emit an unnatural {Rblood {rred {8light. 
He is dressed in heavy plate mail that is scratched and 
dented from years of fighting. His armor and heavy shield
are pitch black and contain no heraldry, the sign of an 
{woutcast {8knight. No longer bound to the rules of chivalry,
he has become a plaything of the gods to exact {yrevenge
{8on mortals foolish enough to challenge him.{x

{RA{rn {RU{rndead {RA{rcolyte{x~
An {RU{rndead {RA{rcolyte {xis here moving steadily north.
~
An undead construct built of what apears to be the bodies
of dead giants.  The flesh practically drips from its bones
as it ambles its way mindlessly northward.  The aura of dark
magics swirl about its body malevolently seeking a target.
Its torso is bloated as if what flesh is still in tact holds
something in.

enough, to get near.  Towering the height of a five story building,
muscled like a behemoth, Erregdal turns his hate-filled gaze onto
