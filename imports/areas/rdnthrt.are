Sevano appears to be a middle-aged gentleman, with long salt and
pepper hair tied back to keep it out of his face while he works.  His
long thing face and aqueline nose give him the appearance of some bird
or prey, especially when coupled with his piercing steel grey eyes. 
After numerous campaigns, and more than a few battle scars, he has
retired to become the Armsmaster of the Order, teaching the next
generation of troops the ways of battle.

~
Myrtle is not what one would call an attractive woman, portly with
a bad complexion, the hair net just sets everything off and brings
back memories of institutional food.  Luckily for the members of the
Order, the appearance is where the similarities end, for Myrtle is a
truly outstanding cook, and serves up some of the most savory fare in
the realms.

Jeeves is a rail thin man.  He has tended the baths for as long as
any can remember, and over the years of being in close proximity to
the priests of both Helm and Torm, has picked up quite a bit about the
healing arts...  Nothing like a good soak for the bones to aid in
healing.

Portcullis of the Outer Gate~
~
{8The Portcullis of the Outer Gate is an imposing strucutre. 
Designed to protect the Keep from attack, this heavy iron grate stands
a massive twelve feet tall and ten feet wide, easily allowing a horse
and rider through when it is open.  The Portcullis is set in an
incredibly thick stone wall, the outer face of the Gatehouse to the
Stronghold of the Order of the Radiant Heart.  Through the four-inch
thick iron bars a dark corridor can be seen to the north, winding into
the depths of the Gatehouse.  {x

Inner Gate of the Stronghold of the Order~
~
{8The {BInner Gate {8of the {RS{rtronghold{8 is yet another imposing structure.
Unlike the Portcullis at the south end of the Gatehouse, the Inner
gate is a massive oak door.  In times of peace, the twelve foot tall
doors are thrown open, allowing visitors to come and go, but in these
troubled times, they are closed and barred.  The doors are more than
twelve inches thick, and a small postern door provides access to foot
traffic for those who have the key.  {x

The Inner Gate to the Stronghold of the Radiant Heart is a stout 
wooden structure.  Standing tall enough to allow a rider and horse 
to enter, this gate is usually closed, owing to the troubling times
we live in.  The gate is at least 12 inches thick, constructed of 
solid oak.  A small postern door allows limited foot traffic into 
the Stronghold.

Dungeon of the Heart~
~
{8The Dungeon of the Heart is typical of most dungeons.  It is a dark
and dank place excavated below the main keep.  The order does not
often house prisoners, and as such, there is only one cell.  There is
only one penalty for significant violations, and that is death.  {cW{ga{ct{ge{cr
{cr{gi{cv{Gul{ce{gt{cs{D run down the walls, pooling here and between the stones of the
floor.  The single cell lies to the south, and a set of slimy stone
stairs leads up.  {x

Chisel marks can be seen in the stone, and the low, rough ceiling

walk this way.  The air is dank and musty, with a small channel of

The Dungeon of the Black Heart~
~
{DDeep within the compound of the {RR{rad{yi{rant {RH{re{ya{rr{Rt{D, lies the Dungeon of
the {WBlack Heart{D.  This chamber is made from old brick and stone that
was left over from the construction of the Great Hall.  Although it
seems weathered with time, the stone and brick can't even be scratched
by the sharpest of swords, or the strongest of spells.  The only other
item of note in this chamber, is a {Yg{yo{Wld{ye{Yn{D rope, tied into a noose at
one end that magically seems to float up and down without any effort. 
This chamber is researved for the most severe crime against the {RR{rad{yi{rant
{RH{re{ya{rr{Rt{D...{WTreason{D.{x
