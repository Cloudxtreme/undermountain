the lower rim are words that read as follows: 
{x
In goes the whip, In goes the mirror
In goes the courage that goblins do fear,
Swallow the lump, and utter the spell:
Say "take my offering and make it well"
Out goes the whip, out goes the mirror
By some strange apparition that will appear
And in that time enchanted, the whip will become
Made anew by a magic that cannot be undone

The western gates of the Mines of Moria.  Long referred to as the
richest of the dwarven mines.  While a mine, it was once also one of
the greatest dwarven cities.  Rich in both its ores and its craftsmen.
Now, it is viewed with horror at what lies within.  It is said that
the dwarves delved too deeply, that they disturbed something ancient
and evil.  The gates are identified by the great blank wall standing
between twin figures with outstretched arms.  You can read fiant runes
inscribed in the stone, yet see no true door.  Only a blank wall
spreads under the arch spanning the raised arms of the two stone
warriors.

treacherous.  Some strange black fungus grows along the base of the
wall, and there is a small trickle of water that disappears into a
crack at the base of the wall.  The center of the passageway seems
slightly worn, yet retains its smooth finish.  A testament to the
craftsmen and stoneworkers who first delved these tunnels.

wares to outsiders.  North, at the center of this large chamber, you
can see the central column.

{Y{#The West Hall{x (Southwest)~
~
This corner of the West Hall is covered in dust and the remains of
what may have once been an armory.  There is a rusted anvil in one
portion, and vairous chain links scattered about among the debris. 
Walkways wind between piles of rotten wood and crumbling stone, but
there is nothing of use that has not already been scavenged here.

{Y{#The West Hall{x (Center)~
~
The center of the West Hall is dominated by a massive column.  The
column stretches to a height of nearly 50 feet, where it merges with
the arches that span the remainder of the ceiling.  The column is
carved in relief, and is a tribute to the masters who once dwelt
within these depths.  It depicts the commerce that once took place
withing the hall.  Since the time of the carving, there has been much
damage done to the carving, and upon close inspection, not all of the
vandalism is old.  The hall stretches out in all directions.

The East Run was delved following one of the first mithril veins in

silver tracings winding through the stone.  The tunnel slopes down to

there is a carved rune next to the silver tracery.

abandoned the thin veins of mithril in these passage as too much work
for too little gain.  Now, one shall never know.  The passage curves

becomes a bit more steep as it slopes down to the north.  The First

this for lack of a better name and to delineate it from the

must have kept the dwarves digging down.  Perhaps it was merely the
fact that dwarves like to dig.  You see a small rune with an arrow
pointing to the east, and on the floor of the passage is a rusty
buckle attached to some moldy leather.

there are several natural pillars as stalagtites and stalagmites fused
together in the natural processes forming the cavern.  There is a
single rune marking the barrier between the Second Neath the the
cavern.  Under this, written in the common tongue are the words {Y{#"The

wide, in truth, only slightly wider than the passageways, but enough
to be noticable.  The walls and floor here are smooth as glass, as if
melted by some huge fire.  Interestingly, in the smooth black surface,
there are pinpricks of the brightest silver, what you take to be
mithril, twinkling like stars in the black obsidian of the walls and
floor.  The Drawing Dark lies to the south, while north lies Dorin's
Peril.

{W             of Dorin, Son of Durin, King of Moria.
{W             He delved deep, following a rich vein

so well crafted, it takes close examination to see where mortar joins
the stone.  The water below the bridge is dark, but occasional milky
white oblong shapes are occasionally seen in its depths.

feet wide, easily allowing two or three people to pass at once, but
the lack of walls along the sides is a bit disconcerting.  It might be
best to walk up the center of the stair, just to be safe.  Below you

of cut granite stones and arches so finely crafted it is hard to see
the mortar in the joints.  The stairs themselves are nearly ten feet
wide, easily allowing two or three people to pass at once, but the
lack of walls along the sides is a bit disconcerting.  It might be
best to walk up the center of the stair, just to be safe.  Far below
you see the landing called the First Rise, while the landing at the
Second Rise waits to the north.

a simple ten foot square, providing a great location for a rest.  The
climb continues above, or there is a stair leading down to the south. 
Both the bottom of the cavern and the ceiling are enshrouded by inky
blackness, giving a feeling of floating in the middle of nothing.

The Fifth Rise is the top of the Long Stair.  The ceiling of the
cavern is about twenty feet above you.  The rise is a simple ten foot
landing, but this one, unlike the others has a short railing along the
outside edges.  To the north is a round chamber and the long stair
descends to the south.

This round chamber at the top of the Long Stair has three doors
leading off to the east, north and west.  Carven arches that were once
well decorated now stand to testify about the neglect this once
magnificent place has undergone.  The stone is scarred and pitted
where weapons have hacked at the carvings.  Once there may have been
directions to where each passage lead, but the stone placards have
been smashed beyond recognition.

A Downward Stair~
~
A wide stair spirals down into the darkness around a large central
column.  The capital of the column is intricately carved, and through
the decay of centuries, you can make out images of what appear to be
daily life for the dwarves carved in relief on the stone.  There are
scenes of mining and ore carts, and smiths and armorers working at
anvils.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear as if much of the work has
escaped at least some sort of damage.

A wide spiral stair descends through the rock here.  Chips of rock
and dust coat the stairs as if a tremor had shaken down part of the
ceiling.  Looking up, you see scorch marks on the high ceiling, and
indeed there are cracks running through the stone.  There is a central
column around which the stairs spiral down, and upon closer
examination you see a small four foot door in the column.

The Carven Corridor~
~
The passageways delved through the stone, tunnels is perhaps a
better term, give way to a worked stone corridor here.  The walls are
fitted stone, with the occasional archway going over the passageway,
lending support and decoration.  Every stone has some adornment here. 
It is a completely different feel than the other passageways.  If it
weren't for the perpetual dark, this might actually seem like a city.

The Broad Hall~
~
The Broad Hall was often called the Westgate, and is the western
entrance to the dwarven city of Dwarrowdelf.  Few mortals, not of
dwarven lineage, were ever granted access this far.  This was an area
for dwarves only, which may be why men referred to Moria as a mine,
and never made mention of the city.  The walls are intricately carved,
utilizing several colors of stone to make the reliefs appear as is
they are painted.  Two massive pillars support the ceiling some fifty
feet above as the hall spreads out all around.

vaults arch gracefully across the ceiling lending both support and
character to the hall.  Carvings continue along the walls, getting mor
intricate if possible, as they approach the Archway of Dwarrowdelf to
the east.  The hall continues to the north, west and south, with the
pair of central pillars flanking the main path to the west.

The true entrance to the city of Dwarrowdelf.  The Archway once
held a stone gate, the remains of which lie shattered and blackened on
the floor.  Some incredible force broke these gates in.  The carvings
on the archway itself are incredible, those that remain intact, and
the use of different colors of stone, the vibrancy of which can still
be seen under the soot, is amazing.

The Great Hold of Dwarrowdelf~
~
The Great Hold of Dwarrowdelf stretches out, the ceiling nearly two
hundred feet above is supported by numerous massive columns.  The
columns must number in the hundreds, for this chamber is vast.  At one
time, this was the heart of the dwarven city.  It was a place few
outsiders were granted admittance.  It was here that the dwarves plied
their craft, smelting the precious mithril ores and crafting it into
works of art.  It was also here that they ate, drank, and lived. 
Unfortunately, something happened, and many of them also died here. 
Many a dwarf has sworn to gain back the wealth of Moria and return
Dwarrowdelf to it's greatness, but none speak of its fall, or what
precipitated it.  Now, the hold is as a massive tomb; dark, cold,
forgotten.

businesses, and in general lived their lives.  At least until some
disaster befell the mines and city.  It is rumored that they dug too
deep, that they disturbed something deep within the earth.  Something
that in the end, brought the glorious city to its knees.  Now
Dwarrowdelf is merely a tomb.

The Great Hold of Dwarrowdelf~

The Great Hold of Dwarrowdelf stretches out, the ceiling nearly two
hundred feet above is supported by numerous massive columns.  The
columns in this vast room must number in the hundreds.  At one time,
this was the heart of the dwarven city and mines, a place few
outsiders were granted admittance.  It was here that the dwarves
worked their craft, creating armor, weapons and other items of
precious mithril.  The city of Dwarrowdelf was the heart of the
dwarves of Moria.  It is where they raised their families, ran

~
A shaft of {Wlight{x angles down into the center of this room
illuminating a single sarcophagus.  Inscribed on the lid are Dwarvish
Runes reading "Here lies Balin, Son of Fundin, King of Moria." 
Corpses of dwarves in rusted armor lie scattered about the room, many
pierced with goblin arrows.  There are nine columns spaced about the
perimeter of the room, each representing one of the nine kings of
Moria.  Balin would have been the tenth.  The room has a small well
near the southern wall.

stone across a massive chasm.  There is nothing to keep one from
falling off the sides, which was perhaps one of the defensive measures
of the dwarves.  It was also rumored that there were hidden pins that
would allow the dwarves to drop the whole bridge in case of an
invasion.  Crossing the Bridge must be done single file.  Blackness
drops off to either side.  To the west lies the rim of the Great Deep,

doors stand pinned back to the walls of the gorge.  The gates
themselves are intricately carved works of stone, showing Moria in all
her glory.  Barely touched by the passage of time, these carvings are
magnificent still.  Ancient stories tell how the King of Moria would
stand here each morning at Dawn to watch the sun rise, following which
the High Priest of Moradin would ring the bell in the Great Hall.  How
many years has it been since that bell last sounded?  The view is
magnificent.  West and into the mountain lies the passageways of
Moria.

mine long before the others you have seen.  Strangely, there is a
stone door hanging on broken hinges to the south.  The stonework of
the wall and door seem to be different than others throughout the
complex, and although the door is shattered, apparently from the
inside out, a strange tracery of runes and symobls can be seen
glittering across the walls and what remain of the doorway.

A Soldier's Path~
~
The Soldier's Path is so named as it was the road to the residences
of the defenders of Moria.  A peaceful city by most standards, they
were still subject to the jealousy of various nations with regards to
their wealth.  As such, the dwarves fought many battles to defend
their city, and in the end, although all dwarves were taught to fight
from a young age, they developed a Warrior's Caste.  It was here that
these Soldiers lived and trained.  For many, it was also here that
they died.

~
The North Run was dug chasing the first mithril vein discovered by

hundred pounds of ore.  The passageway moves from the West Hall to the
south and heads north, there are still small spiderwebs of mithril
glinting in the light.  The walls of the passageway are uneven, as the
dwarves would dig small pockets to get at the ore, leaving small
alcoves.  Small runes and what look like test holes are spaced along
the walls.

reappeared in the walls, and the floor is fairly even.  The mine

color.  Several buildings about the realms can still be seen boasting
of their blue granite of Moria.  Mithril flecks are conspicuously

this was once a stone quarry for the {C{^light blue granite{x that you

following some quality in the stone that you cannot comprehend, for
the present walls look the same all around, and there are no clues as

had been.

Dorin's Crevasse~
~
The walls of the Dorin's Crevasse are natural stone, never having
seen the bite of pick, chisel or drill.  They are uneven granite,
varying from ten to thirty feet wide.  Dorin's fall to the depths must

under one particularly impressive stone you can just see the bones of
a hand within a rusted gauntlet.  Perhaps it is the remains of Dorin.

There is a book niche beside each pallet that may have once held

wall, obviously for hanging the implements of their trade, as well as
the occasionally needed cloak.  The room has a somewhat oppressive air

The entryway also has some built in niches or book shelves scattered

throughout the room.  The bedroom lies to the east through a shattered

The Captain's Bedroom is spartan, as one would think most soldiers
would be.  Even though no one has slept here, or even lived here for
centuries, it is still identifiable as a bedroom.  There is a stone
pallet in one corner, and an intricately carved table inlaid with what
looks like a map of Moria.  The map is inlaid in various colors
denoting different areas, perhaps having different purposes.

Temple Road~
~
Temple Road stretches from the Great hold to the west to the Temple
of Moradin to the east.  Moradin was the patron god of the dwarves of
Moria, and as such, his is the only temple here.  The road is of
simple black granite, but inlaid down the center of the road is a line
of {WMithril{x leading from Dwarrowdelf to the temple, a lavish gift to
their god, leading the way to his temple.

columns of {C{^B{Blu{C{^e{x Marble.  Between these columns are six steps
leading up into the Temple.  A relief of an anvil and crossed hammers
is carved above the lintel of the massive door.  Even now, there is
the sense of some divine presence about the building.

north lies the Altar of Moradin, while the Priest's Chambers lie to
the south.  Various scenes depicting Moradin at work and at war are
shown carved in the walls of this circular chamber.  Of note, the
central panel, and the largest carving on the wall, shows Moradin
granting the dwarves the Mines of Moria.

of the room.  Iron braziers hang from chains suspended from the
ceiling on either side.  The top of the altar is inscribed with
dwarvish runes.  From the braziers, there still remains a scent of
frankincense that was once burnt within as an offering to their god. 
Tapestry rods lacking their once elaborate hangings are suspended from
the walls of the chamber.

and Smiths.  The walls of the room are covered in an intricate design
of carved anvils and hammers.  There is a small alcove with an anvil
still standing in it along the eastern wall.  The anvil is covered in
Dwarven Runes and looks to be solid mithril.  A stone pallet rests
along the western wall, and a writing desk stands beside the door to
the north.

The southeast corner of the Great Deep.  Rock litter is strewn
across the bottom of the chasm, and water can be heard faintly in the
distance.  The inky blackness of the chasm is oppressive and it feels
as if the weight of the mountain is about to come tumbling down.  It
is almost claustrophobic, the black basalt, the granite, the weight of
a whole mountain resting upon this little space.

Some great earthquake must have caused this fissure long ago.  Granite
walls rise to the south, and the deep continues to the north, east and
west.  Each step seems to echo in the distance, and in the far
distance, water can be heard rushing through somewhere.

and used as a sort of under the mountain highway by them for
centuries.  From this angle, it is hard to believe that it could
support any weight at all, but then again, it was build by dwarves. 
Inky blackness presses in from all around, bringing to mind the
numbing oblivion that is everywhere in this place.

In the Air In the Great Deep~
~
In the air of the Great Deep.  Above and to the south lies the
Bridge of Khazad-Dum, a frail looking structure build by the dwarves
and used as a sort of under the mountain highway by them for
centuries.  From this angle, it is hard to believe that it could
support any weight at all, but then again, it was build by dwarves. 
Inky blackness presses in from all around, bringing to mind the
numbing oblivion that is everywhere in this place.

Under the Bridge of Khazad-Dum in the Air~

In the air of the Great Deep.  It is hard to make out any details
in this void, being able to see neither up, down or to the sides. 
Floating in the black nothing of the Great Deep, never knowing when
you may smack into something unpleasant and hard.  Then again, perhaps
it will never happen.  Perhaps there is nothing above or below. 
Perhaps none of this is real.  Then again...

The bottom of the chasm is littered with debris.  On the edge of
the river here, there is also a layer of slime and algae which makes
the footing here treacherous.  A white type of moss grows on some of
the boulders and rocks littering the ground, giving them a sort of
hairy, snowlike appearance that is somehow unsettling and somewhat
repulsive.  An underground river lies to the north and west, while the
rock strewn bottom of the chasm stretches to the east and south.

An underground river lies to the north, its waters lapping hungrily
at the stone at the edge of the room.  The current moves rapidly by,
and the dampness has provided the perfect atmosphere for slime and
moss to grow thickly upon the stones.  Hairy white rocks litter the
shoreline, and occasionally an equally hairy black spider can be seen
scuttling between them.  The river lies to the north, while to the
west, south and east lies the bottom of the Great Deep.

A A strange corner of the Great Deep.  At the bottom of the chasm
lies this rubble strewn room.  Rock dust and debris lie everywhere,
attesting to the millenia these stones have witnessed.  Inky blackness
surrounds everything and the only sounds that can be heard is the
rushing of water somewhere in the distance.  It is hard to tell
exactly where it is coming from as the sound echoes off the walls. 
The floor of the Deep continues to the west and south.

rush below, and to the southwest there is a strange gurgling sound. 
The surface of the water has been whipped to a froth here, and it is
impossible to see the true color of the turbid water.  Sheer walls
rise to either side, all in black granite with some silver tracery.

An Underground River~
~
The gorge continues to narrow with the water rushing rapidly below.
The strange sound to the southwest continues to grow in volume.  White
water sprays upward and a strange luminescent moss grows on the walls
here.  It looks as if it will be a tight squeeze as the gorge heads to
the west.

An Underground River~
~
The narrow defile curves around to the east to the south.  The
white water continues to churn below and that strange gurgling sound
in nearly deafening in volume now.  The luminescent moss grows even
thicker here, adding its own light to the gorge's sheer granite walls.

An Underground River~
~
The gorge terminates here.  The rushing water continues to flow
from the north to the south, but you can go no farther as the water
disappears into a hole in the granite of the southern wall.  This is
the source of the deafening gurgle.  The moss grows so thick here,
that it is almost painful to the eyes.  The river flows down from the
north.

Dorin's Well~
~
The bottom of Dorin's Well.  Rather than a well holding water, it
appears as if this well were a sort of treasury.  Unfortunately, most
everything has been pillaged from it over the years.  The walls are
worked stone and niches along the wall, as well as empty pegs hint at
this place's former purpose.  A few bits of rusted metal litter the
floor, and occasionally small glints are seen reflecting the light.

The Path to Moria~
~
The small windy path leading to the Gates or Moria edges around the
northwest corner of a stagnant black pool here.  Skeletal fingers of
long dead trees reach up from the pitch black waters.  The path is
bordered on one side by the black pool, and on the other by a high
grey cliff, not truly a cliff but the steeply rising side of the
mountain.  The path is covered in shale dust and chips that make
footing somewhat treacherous.

Approaching the Mines of Moria~
~
This path is small and slowly winds down along the flank of the
mountain.  The footing is somewhat treacherous as it winds down,
attributed to a bit of shale and other rock debris.  The landscape
becomes more barren as one winds down and further down the path is
something that reflects the light, looking somewhat like water.  The
trees are scragly and windblown along this part of the trail, but to
the best of knowledge, this is the only path to Moria.

The Black Pool~
~
The Black Pool is full of stagnant water and dead trees.  The only
path to the Gates of Moria circles this pool to the west and north. 
The still waters reflect the somber grey of the cliff faces and
highlight the skeletal branches of the dead trees stretching up from
the black water.  Occasionally the waters ripple as if some large fish
is chasing some elusive prey near the surface, but how something could
live in that pool is beyond comprehension.

Entrance to the Forges~
~
The entrance to the Dwarven Forges still holds the smell of molten
metal in the air, although now, there is also another overlying
stench.  An odor that doesn't quite belong.  A mixture of Goblin and
strangely what you might only describe as brimstone.  Metal shavings
cover the floor and crunch softly underfoot.  While the dust is thick,
there are footprints of other things that have passed this way.  From
the look of them, unwholesome things...

The Foundry Floor~
~
The foundry floor is the center of Moria's Forge.  It was here that
the finished goods were brought from the various smiths spaced around
the forge.  Metal shards and various pieces of leather straps and
tools lie shattered around the room.  There are some strange holes in
the floor and it almost looks as if there were once wooden structures
built around the perimeter of the room, perhaps market stalls.

Weapons Smith~
~
A Large central forge dominates the middle of the room.  Numerous
anvils stand spread around it.  There are hundreds of pegs on the
walls all still hung with various tongs and hammers, although none of
them seems quite whole.  It almost appears as if something
intentionally destroyed the tools in the room and bits of broken metal
are scattered everywhere.  In one corner is a scattered pile of bar
stock, but even that appears to have been picked through and the
remaining bars are bent at strange angles.  Amidst the broken tools
there appear to be broken weapons as well, leading to the belief that
this room was once occupied by the fabled Dwarven Weapons Smiths of
Moria.

Smelting Room~
~
The Smelting Room is where the dwarves melted down and purified
their metals prior to passing them on to their craftsmen for making
various items.  Large pots line the walls of this huge room, all of
them containing the residue of molten metals.  Levers line the north
wall to move these pots over fires to heat the contents.  Stacked near
the pots are forms for various ingots.  All of these implements are
marked with various runes, assumably marking what they were used for. 
The smell of molten metal is thick in the air, even though these
appear to have not been used for centuries.

Armory~
~
A large central forge dominates the center of the room with anvils
evenly spaced around it.  The remains of shattered tools hang from
hundreds of pegs spaced about the wall, all of which seem to have been
intentionally shattered.  The walls are scored by what may be arrow
and sword strikes, although at this point it is hard to tell.  Amidst
the refuse littering the room are odd bits of armor; broken,
shattered, or otherwise rendered unusable.  This room must be what
remains of the once proud forge of the Armor Smiths of Moria.

Ore Chamber~
~
Piles of rock lay strewn about the room, most with very
identifiable veins running through them.  The room appears to be a
storage depot for Ore prior to the smelting process.  Strange wear
marks can be seen in the floor beneath the detritus of rock chips and
metal shavings that dominate the area.  They almost look like wagon
tracks.  A thick layer of dust blankets the floor, although this is
broken by intermittent footprints of something passing through.  It
looks like something has been using one corner of the room as a
latrine, and the smell of that almost completely overpowers that of
the metals in the room.

say Well, we were on the bridge, the dwarves called it Khazad-Dum,
say when suddenly that vile beast the Balrog caught up to us.
