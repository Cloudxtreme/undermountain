titan lore~
[Excerpt from the first chapter] {x

The titan exodous from the higher plains came about in a relatively short
amount of time. The event is recorded in titan legend as a shooting star
from celestial beginnings and portrays six elder titans descending from
their planescape to a lush valley surrounded by forest and mountains. 
It was in that valley that the first titans came to settle here in the
Great Realms. Centuries of peace saw two key changes to titan culture
1) titans shed away their fierce, warlike nature and made communion with
their surrounding natural environment creating what they themselves call
the strengthening of mind 2) as sons and daughters of the greater gods,
titans were blessed with immortality and immense stature. Centuries of
peaceful existence among mortals saw their size shrink down to sizes
more indicative of the humanoids about them. Titans though long living,
are not immortal. Still they are rumored to live very long lives, some
argue for millenia. Indeed titans are a strange and wonderful race.

Dark Path Through The Forest~
~
You suddenly realize that the forest around you has changed drastically. 
The once bright day is now quite overcast and dull. A sharp wind suddenly 
picks up and brings a cool chill to your bones. All around you you hear the 
chilling sounds of the forest, almost like it was out of a story book. 
The dusty road continues north and south, winding around a curve up ahead, 
making the end of the road, or what it will bring to, impossible to see. 
A large sign is here, demanding your attention. (look sign)
     There is a small (Glowing) (Humming) tablet.

Long Dusty Trail~
~
The path continues, and the view is still not as interesting.  The sky
has become more dark and it appears that the clouds are filled with rain. 
The faint smell of autumn; the rotting of leaves on the moist forest floor,
adds to the quaint scene.  A rustle in the trees above you finally shows
life in the dreary forests.  The path turns and continues west, and south

Clearing in the Woods~

Suddenly the path comes to an open section on the road.  You realize that
mountainous peaks stab sharply into the sky, creating a look of might, a
look of power.  Lush green plants can be found in all directions, speckled
with the odd reds and yellows of the wild flowers.  A small brook trickles
alongside the path, adding a harmonious tune with the soft whistle of the
scarcely known Grey Bird.  A soft mist whisps slowly past, cascading over
the brook, creating a beautiful soft atmosphere.  The path continues west

The bright warm sunshine seems to lighten your heart, as you notice you
have lost all sense of direction.  The quaint small brook that followed you
from the east, is slowly gaining speed.  Mountains of all sizes tower up
sky- high above you, creating a wondrous view of the lands.  The crisp cool
air seems to add new strength to your sore old bones.  The path continues

Alongside A Wild Waterfall~
~
So much for a quaint little brook.  The what once was small brook is now
a raging waterfall, crashing and thumping against the rocks, as it viciously
works its way, still off to the north of your path.  You notice the
mountains seem to encase you in a valley, forever growing taller and more
mighty with every step.  A dark green moss seems to cover the trees about
you, camouflaging the wild animals of the woods.  It seems as though these
trees and plants are older than time itself, yet have never aged a day.  The
ground is covered in soft brown pine neddles, matting your heavy footsteps. 
Several large boulders are scattered here and there throughout the woods. 
The path continues west and back east.

Sharp Bend in the Road~
~
You come face to face with a mighty mountain wall, blocking your path. 
You feel like you have wasted all your time and effort just to get here, to
find a dead end.  Right before you give up you notice a flicker of movement
to your right.  You turn, yet you see nothing.  Suddenly you realize a small
matted path curves around the mountain, almost like a deer trail.  Perhaps
you should follow it to see where it takes you.  The path continues north,
through the deer trail, and east, where you came from.

Windy Deer Trail~

You are on a windy deer trail, which seems to swerve this way and that. 
The sounds of the forests are about you, weaving together in a harmonious
tune, with the wind in the trees as its melody.  The soft mist on your face
seems to wet your boots as well, adding to the special touches of the woods.
Annoying little spider webs seem to stick to your face and clothes, making
this trip very much unenjoyable.  Up ahead you see that the path widens.

to a lose gravel and begins to be flatter than before.  The massive wall of

At a Quaint Little Bridge~
~
Well, you were right.  The wall of the mountain does jut out and block
your path, but a quaint little bridge lies to the north, created by a human,
or some other creature.  It seems quite stable and safe to cross.  A
beautiful brook trickles slowly underneath the small bridge, creating a
relaxing sound.  The forest seems to be more lush on the other side of the
brook.  The path continues north, across the bridge, or east, back to the
path.

You have made it past the peaceful bridge and are now on a woodchip
covered trail.  The peaceful sounds of the Blue Birds and the joyous chatter
of the chipmunks add to the beauty of these lands.  The tall Oak and Maple
are just some of the numerous trees you recognize.  Beautifully lush ferns
fill the gaps between trees; a little Red Juliefire sprouting out here and
there, giving the forest floor a wider variety of color and beauty.  In the
distance you hear the rushing of a waterfall, and the loud soulful cry of
the Black Crane.  The path continues west and back to the bridge south.

As you continue to walk down this glorious path, you notice that the
sounds of the waterfall are getting louder and clearer.  The sun plays
shadow games with the wind through the trees, lightening your heart with
joy.  Deep in the bush you see a bright red Pinion bird, rare to all parts
of the world save the most beautiful.  The trees and plants seem to almost
glow with peace.  This is such a beautiful place, you never wish to leave. 
A soft breeze lifts your hair and brings you the fresh scent of Golden
Wildflowers, making you wish you were in a sunny field, rolling in them. 
But you still would much rather be here.  The path continues west and east.

Great Lookout~
~
You are standing about 300 feet above the raging rapids of The River of
Venis.  You realize that the trees did a great job concealing this massive
cliff.  Right beside you there is a massive waterfall that tumbles down at a
glorious speed.  It is amazing how powerful these falls are.  A well crafted
bridge swings the span of the cliff, right in front of the waterfall.  You
would hate to make a mistake and take a step off the bridge.  The path
continues out south across the bridge, or back east to the trail.

Still the white foam at the bottom looks as soft as clouds, and the speed of
the falls brings a cool, fresh breeze.  Just being this high up is so
exhilarating, you could stay here for ever!  The bridge continues south or

Druid Lord's Secret Study~
~
You have stumbled into the most beautiful room you have ever seen! giant 
slabs of white marble with the accasional greyish streak through them cover 
every bit of the floor, save for the far south of this room, which has 
a gloryious carpet, telling the tales of several great battles, all woven 
into the magical design. Tall book shelves cover the eastern wall of this 
cavern; books of lore, magic, spells, ceremonies and much more. A giant
oak desk lies infront of the bookshelves, covered with paper and all of 
Xavier's work. A light blue chair rests in the northern corner. A thin line 
of glass-like whater cascades down the western opening creating a magical 
window. Etched in stone high above this wonderous site are the words 
'Mirror of The Worlds'. You gaze into the light white waters and see your 
past. Despite being inside a dark cave, this study seems to be quite 
comfortable. Several bright torches line the walls, and one giant blue flame 
floats magically in the top-most center of the cave. Magic just seems to flow 
through this cave, magic beyond your wildest wonders. You wonder where the 
exits are.

Tulips and Rose bushes line the pathway, adding once again to the beauty of 
this strange land. The tall trees seem to give off the right amount of shade, 
to keep you from getting too hot in this sun. The path you are one is kind of 
like one you would have up to your house; big enough for one or two people,
long and curvy. The mountains loom even higher in the distance than they ever 
had before. You can tell that each step takes you down hill, into a vally of 
some sort. The land about you appears as though it was formed ages ago, due 
to earthquakes and storms. The path continues north to the bridge, or south

in a wonderous valley. It would be interesting to see what this place is

Path To A Very Fancy House~

You are now walking on a stone walkway to a very fancy house. Nicely trimmed 
flowers and bushes lie in neatly tended patterns along the dark green grass 
at the fron of the house. The house itself is huge and white. It appears to be 
two stories high, and it looks to be as though this house belonged to a Lord
or a Lady, or someone with LOTS of money. You wonder who would live in such 
an extravagent house. The exits are east to the house, or west to the main

to keep it so neat and tidy. You do not wish to intrude so you mine aswell

You walk along a winding road, that meanders to and fro and it
begins to curve around and descend into the valley. Along both
sides stretch great mountains, shrouded in clouds at the peaks.
Along all sides are many trees and lush vegetation. The air is
cool and crisp coming down from the mountain. The roadway here
continues eastward to a crossing, and westward into the valley.

less abundant, replaced by rocks.  The road runs east and west.

and become forest on all sides. There are fresh tracks in the
dirt, and far off in the distance, you can make out the faint
outline of a few travelers.  The road continues east and west.

the crossing through a forest.  South the road descends down a
final stretch before reaching what appears to be a bridge that
goes over a circling river though closer inspection hints that
the water does not flow, making it more of a moat than a river.
Perhaps it was once made to defend the village which stands at
the inner island though the open bridge gates suggest that the
times of war have long since carried over into peaceful times.

At The Bridge Gates~
~
{x
The valley road opens up to a lush clearing that spans on level
with the vast stretch of buildings far to the south.  From here
to there spans a wide dropoff lined with stonework on all sides.
This moat is much larger than any you have seen before, as wide
as four city streets side to side, and deeper than the Istar at
the eve of the late spring floods.  In fact, everything here to
the south is scaled up, even the villagers that play within the
fringes of this village, which is less village than great city.{x

Beginning of The Bridge~

{x
The bridge gates remain open, and here begins the double bridge
that stretches across the titanmade moat below.  The moat drops
dizzyingly to darkness, twenty plus paces before water fills it,
and anyone's guess how much deeper the dark waters go before it
reaches the bottom. For humans, this moat would be a chasm that
none could bound or build across.  For titans, it is still much
of an impasse though still lingering in their minds as feasable.{x

Along The Bridge~
~
{x
The bridge is made of thick timbers that stand interlocked with
intricate joinings, seemingly without metal or rope fastens. It
is nearly completely flat, unlike most modern arched bridges in
other developed places, suggesting the titans know how to build
a weight bearing structure better than most, the thought passes
better than even the dwarves, though in wood not stone. Between
the two bridges sit many lush plants that the women of the town
tend to daily stretching as gargantuan as the titans themselves.{x

The titans you pass are friendly and cordial, stopping to greet
strangers and carrying on long conversations with their friends.
One wouldn't think they had just been through a bloody war, but
there does remain a hint of hesitation whenever anyone from the
northern lands pass through.  A strong breeze blows through the
ornate handrails of the bridges, which sit ten feet up from the
baseboards. Between the two bridges there is enough room for an
army to pass two and fro freely, and enough space for six carts
to travel side by side, with room left over for walking between.{x

Middle of The Bridge~

You have finally reached the middle of the Bridge. Everyone seems to be going 
at the same pace, no one seems to be in any hury what-so-ever. You notice that 
some of the people are dressed really well. In fact, it seems as though
everyone is dressed neatly. You feel a little out of place, wearing your
traveling gear and battle armor. Maybe in town you can buy yourself some
descent clothes, that is if they will accept your gold. The path continues

find an imm with a nice, cozy bed and room. A piping hot meal wouldn't be bad
either. The bridge continues south to the town entrance, and north, back to

Welcome to The City of The Titans! Many races are known and accepted 
here. This city consists of more people than Westbridge, Thalos and Ofcol 
put together! You wonder where the best Inn would be. It would be nice to 
kick of your hiking boots and site down to a warm fire and a long, enjoyable 
pipe. Better start looking for an Inn. The exits are west and east to the

large house line this Cul-De-Sac. To the south you see a large white house, 
set about 20 feet or so behind a large wooden fence. A well tended yard 
greets you with beauty in front of this house. To the east you see a large 
grocer. To the west there is an Apothecary. The exits are north to the 
side-streets, south the the yard of the house, east to the very large grocer

a dark green and light yellow potions. Many runes and scrolls cover the walls, 
where there is not shelves. A white bear rug is under your feet, giving the

removed, the extra long grass in the yard, and the window that needs to be 
replaced are just some of the give-aways. The only exits is north, back

Walking along the western side roads you see that this is one of the less 
popular areas of the kingdome. A scattered shop here and there, several 
beggars lieing on the roads; cats rummaging through a pile of garbage near by. 
Even for the poor part of the city, in less common cities like New Thalos or 
Ofcol, this would be considered one of the richer parts of town. Grey stones 
pave the road and sidewalks. The exits are east to the Southern main road, 
west to the end of this road, north to a pub and south to a back alley.

laughing loudly, sining with the music, and having a really good time. You can 
see that half of them are patrol guards. A short and stuby little man is 
rushing around, making sure everyone has a mug full of beer. A large bar stands
over to your right, with several people sitting at the tables talking to each
other. You notice that there is a second room to your left. The exits are south

On Top of The City Walls~

High above the clammer of the city, you find yourself on an outer wall. 
It seems as though the owner of the Pub managed to pursuade the queen into 
letting him use the top of the wall as a dinning lounge. Very few people are 
here but they do seem to be enjoying themselves. From this high up you can 
see the whole city with the monsterous castle towering above all the rest. 
You  notice that the city is on an island and right at the very bottom of 
the Valley. Beautiful green forests suround the outer walls, making it seem 
as though you are in a private heaven. There is a small dance floor to the 
east and the stairwell down.

you have ever come across, and you wish never to leave. To the north you see a
quaint little container shop. To the south and old-fashioned library.

Secret Passage Behind The Bookcase~

Upon lifting a great book on Titan lore, the bookcase opens infront of you, 
leading into a secret passage. You quickly scrambled in, with the bookcase 
closing shut behind you. Very dim torches light this stone corridor, making 
it almost impossible to see. It seems to be a dead end, or at least it needs 
a key to get back into the library. You wonder what mysterious things lie 
ahead, where does the path lead to, where shall you end up? The only exit is 
west, and, if you had the key, back north to the balcony.

Before you give up all hope, you notice a small little door near the ground.
No, not a door but a grate leading out side! You beed down to get a closer

A sign is on the wall, writen in blood. It reads:
 
     "BE GONE! You do not belong here! If I catch you here, messing 
                     with my pets I shall SLAY you!"

     The Keeper of The Deadly Pets.
