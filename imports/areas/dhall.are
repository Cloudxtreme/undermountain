The Dragon's Hoard is a close-knit brotherhood of elite thieves, merchants,
and other renegades. Their main focus is to control trade routes and areas of
high activity... by whatever means necessary. Greed for money and power
drives this bloodthirsty bunch. What becomes of their lootings is shrouded in
mystery. It is thought that the DHPK fortress contains rooms stashed full of 
blood-riches. They are known far and wide for undertaking daring and often 
devious acts all for a simple profit. As a side to make ends meet they are 
also known to carry out assassinations and other criminal activities for the 
right price. This is not a group to be taken lightly. The DHPK has proven 
themselves ruthless and willing to do anything to become wealthy like the DHM, 
but is disowned by the merchants of DHM for their ruthless and willingness.
 
The Dragon's Hoard was created centuries ago in the world of the Forgotten
Realms.  The band consisted of renegade Drow, who left the darkness of The
Underdark, only to loot and pillage the small villages above. After Nisstyre
was killed in the great battle of Skullport, the DHPK somewhat disbanded,
until Nisstyre's resurrection. They systematically followed their Captain to
the new world, the Great Realms, where new opportunities for success lie in
waiting. Now, many years later the DHPK is lead by some of the most notorious
beings in the realms. These brave souls rejuvenated the clan created by
Nisstyre and continue to seek new methods of amassing wealth and power.

You stand in a large keep made of thick stone that looks like it
could withstand the impact force of Ragnarok itself.  The walls and
floor are covered in a moss that look to have been growing for a long
time.  To the north and south are the long hallways commonly called the
{!Corr{1idor in the {!Keep{x.  In the center of the room is a huge statue of
our founder, {bN{8isstyre{x, next to that is a fountain quietly bubbling with {^spa{6rkl{^ing
