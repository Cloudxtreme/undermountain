The Shrine of Teron{0~
~
{2Here is the most beautifully crafted stone in all the realms.  It
tries to catch your eye's fullest attention and seems to glow with
warm and friendly energy made of the most oldest magic.  Looking at
runes and see this is Teron, our most loved and magical god of unity. 
He provides us protection, warmth and spirit.  {0

The Entrance to {bE{Bl{^v{6ia{^n{Bc{be{0~
~
Stepping upon the forestal steps of this gigantic room, bright and
beautiful lights coming from magical symbols of war shine down.  A
partially hidden garden where there are lots of fresh mushrooms to be
picked.  Around you are elven figures talking and singing.  It is a
truly beautiful sight.  A safe and protective aura permiates the room,
these elves are the allies of the Elviance.  To the south is a door
made of plants and to north is the main entrance doorway.  To the
west, Elven Warriors being equipped with famous Elven Bows as they
prepare to hunt in the beautiful Sharlandel forest area.
