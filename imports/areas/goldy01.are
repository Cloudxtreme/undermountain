You sit in the bottom of a huge pit. Smooth stone walls surround you
keeping you from trying to climb out. There is no light source here 
at all so you can barely see anything at all. The dirt floor is littered
with skeletal remains and old equipment of the poor souls that rotted here
long ago.

An Observatory~
~
You stand in a HUGE circular room with intricate engravings on the
cold stone walls.  There is little light in this room, just small
flickers of lumination given off by the torches that line the walls. 
A gentle breeze of fresh air moves your through your hair as you enter
the room and notice a gaping hole in the ceiling.  Surrounding the
circular hole in the ceiling are more carvings and what looks like
small gems sparkling in the torchlight.

The construction throughout this room is some of the
finest in all of the realms.  Constructed for the Gond
by his loyal followers, it seem this room could withstand
any force thrown against it.  Along all the walls hang
various creations that Gond has bestowed upon the world
through various craftsmen and smiths.  The room is illuminated
and heated from a large fire burning inside of a brick
furnace in the the rear of the room and several metal
torches hung throughout the room.  An elaborate rug lies
along the length of the room, leading to an intricate
throne showing off the finest metal work the realms have
to offer.
