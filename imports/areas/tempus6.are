Stone Golem~
A large, stone statue stands here shaped like a huge man wearing plate armor.
~
You are staring in awe at a 15 foot tall stone statue, that isn't really a statue, but a magical creature bent on upholding his creator's wishes.
To stand in his way is to surely face doom.

The behir is a snake-like reptilian monster whose dozen legs allow it to
move with considerable speed and give it the ability to climb.  It can fold
its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake-fashion.  The
head looks more crocodilian than snake-like, but has no difficulty in
opening its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, the way a snake does. 
The behir has band-like scales of great hardness, which are a deep shade of
blue.  Two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous enough.

The {rBl{Roo{rdy {8Crypt{x~
~
Before you stands the bloody crypt. A holy burial ground for priests
and clerics of the realms. All holy men and women of any God can wish
to be buried here upon demise. Recently a priest and a cleric of {%C{8y{5r{8i{%c{7,
the {5Prince {8of {%L{8i{5e{%s{7, and a priest and a cleric of {4T{8a{#l{8o{4s{7, the {4S{8t{#o{8r{4m L{8o{#r{4d{7
joined forces and decided to curse this holy place, as homage to their
respected Gods. Seeing this great act of love for their Gods, {%C{8y{5r{8i{%c{7 and 
{4T{8a{#l{8o{4s{7 channelled a very minute amount of power through their followers
giving them the power they needed for this incantation. The incantation
was completed and in turn cursed this holy place, twisting and deforming
all within. No one dares enter anymore nor do any of the holy get buried
here. This is a horribly cursed place, and only the damned shall ever
reside here. Be warned, none have exited alive.

Hall of Ceremonies~

This huge room was once a holy place where the ceremony of the dead was
preformed on new inhabitants in the crypt.  It was beautifully decorated
with tile designs, that are now flaking away revealing mold and moss.  Rows
of pews lie broken and strewn across the room.  The floor tiles have been
upheaved and vines have begun to sprout from where they were.

it is too dark to make anything out in it.  It could be nothing, but I would
watch my step.

This is the center of the hall, and is cluttered with the most rubble. 
It seems the ceiling has fallen away the most here and there is a good pile
of mortar and broken pews.  The altar is directly north on a dais, and the
seems to be a hallway branching off this hall to the east.  To the south is
the Entrance Hall.

You are on the east side of the hall, which doesn't have much ceiling
rubble, but a couple of pews have been piled up here.  The pile of splinters
from the pews sorta blocks the way down the hallway to the east.  Hopefully
the pews were piled to block the way in, and not to keep something out. 
Because if it was made to hold something back, it didn't work because you
find it easy to get into the hallway.

Altar of Ceremonies~
~
Here is where the funerals and ceremonies of the dead were preformed. 
Any chosen high priest could preform a ceremony here, for originally all the
Gods of the Realms blessed this crypt.  But now the altar is cracked, and
the tapestry behind the altar is faded and torn, not legible any longer. 
The dais you stand on is not in good shape either.  It is broken and
cracked, and pebbles of stone roll and grind under your feet and you walk.

You stand surrounded by fire and heat of all kinds.  Lava pumps
from small craters in the ground, oozing in all directions.  Jets of
searing flame spew forth randomly, sending bursts of fire everywhere. 
The ground beneath your feet is cracked and dry.  The heat is
unbearable and you begin to feel a bit dizzy.

before the cathedral entrance.  The trees look unearthly and most of all

A Small Cave~
~
You have entered a small cave.  It isn't all that big, perhaps 10 feet
from side to side.  Your nose cringes at the smell of mildew and mold.

there is only one way to find out.  (thank Eron for the change of

A Large Dirt Hole~
~
You are now crawling down a 20 foot diameter hole dug into the earth by
someone...  Or something.  The dirt walls are moist and dirt crumbles off as
you climb downward.  Rain from the storm above pours over the edge above you
and runs down the walls.

You continue your trek climbing down the large hole.  You still cannot
see what is below you, but you sense that the bottom cannot be too far away.
Water runs down the walls, making gripping the walls hard and your climb
slow and tedious.

Bottom of a Large Hole~
~
You have foolishly climbed down into the lair of a gigantic snake-like
reptilian creature.  Deep blue band-like scales cover its body.  It begins
moving its dozen legs, half walking, half slithering towards you with a
hungry look on its crocodilian head.
