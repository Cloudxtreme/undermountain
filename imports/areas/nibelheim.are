{Ya yo{yu{Wn{Yg {Yc{yho{Wc{Yob{Yo{x~
A tame {Yyo{yu{Wn{Yg {Yc{yho{Wc{Yob{Yo{x with a saddle is here.

stands about 7' tall at the top of its head and has bright yellow plumage
all over its body.  There is a leather saddle on the large bird's back
making it ready to accommodate any rider.

a {Wch{wu{Yb{Wby c{Yh{wo{Wcobo{x~
A very fat {Wch{wu{Yb{Wby c{Yh{wo{Wcobo{x, somehow strapped with a saddle, stands here.
~
This chocobo looks very different from the majority of its species.  It
only stands about 5' tall and has relatively short white plumage that
covers its very rotund body.  Far from the long and graceful legs of its
brethren, the legs of this animal are short and stumpy.  Somehow a saddle
has been strapped around this bird's broad body and it looks like it can
be ridden.

{y| {wI have invented a new method for extracting the raw mako  {y||

{y| {wThis method works by opening fractures within deep rock   {y||
{y| {wlayers through the use of highly pressurized liquids.     {y||
{y| {wBy simply drilling a single well bore, then pressurizing  {y||
{y| {wit sufficiently to create fractures within the surround-  {y||
{y| {wing rock layers, we can allow much greater upwelling of   {y||
{y| {wthe lifestream from deep within the planet and increase   {y||
{y| {wour rate of extraction 5x or more.  In addition, by only  {y||
{y| {whaving to drill a single small bore hole, this will allow {y||
{y| {wus to extract the mako from locations previously thought  {y||
{y| {wunreachable through conventional means.                   {y||

{y| {wOf note, I recommend privacy and secracy in developing    {y||
{y| {wthis new method.  We have already faced resistance to     {y||
{y| {wour extraction of mako from the planet and this method    {y||
{y| {wdoes necessitate destruction of underlying geologic       {y||
{y| {wlayers.  In addition, there is possibility of contami-    {y||
{y| {wnation of surrounding groundwater by the forced upwell-   {y||
{y| {wing of the lifestream mako.  However, this is a benefit   {y||

Road to Nibelheim~
~
A dusty cobblestone road leads east to the village of Nibelheim.
Situated at the base of Mt. Nibel, it is a small village where the
major commerce comes from the mako reactor located on top of the
materia rich mountain.  It is also notable as the childhood home
of Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockheart.

Village Path~

This cobblestone path is the major throughfare through the village
of Nibelheim.  The rocks are covered in a light layer of dirt as they
make a circular path around the water tower in the center of town.
There aren't a large number of buildings to be seen but they can all
be accessed from this one road.

Base of the water tower~
~
The water tower that is the central landmark for the town of
Nibelheim rises up here.  A tall wooden scaffolding holds up
the large metal tank that retains the water for the village.
The pump which draws the water up from the ground is wind
powered, meaning this structure probably predates the reactor
that now supplies mako energy to the area.

Nook~
~
This is a very small room that doesn't look like it has
been used for a while.  It is quite cluttered with a large
table and a wardrobe blocking a door to the north.  A lovely
painting of a woman in a white dress hangs on the wall.

Great Room~
~
This beautiful and spacious great room makes up the majority
of the west wing of the mansion.  During the day, the sun will
shine through two beautiful full length stained glass windows
in the north wall.  There is a small round table with chairs
in a nook off to the left side of the room.  There is also a
grand piano in the corner just waiting to be played.

room to the west, the entry room to the south, and the kitchen
to the east.  The north wall is lined with windows.  Though

Storage Room~
~
This storage room seems to contain most of the supplies
that would be needed in the kitchen.  It is packed full of
barrels, boxes, crates, and chests.  From the faint squeak
of mice that can be heard, it's safe to assume there's not
anything edible left here.

leading upstairs from the main entry room of the mansion.
The three grand windows extending up to the vaulted ceiling
can be seen up close.  They are dusty but still provide an
excellent view of Mt. Nibel in the distance.  The hall
continues to the west and east.

to fit more than one person inside.  Otherwise, the room looks
like an office with a large bookcase, a table with chair, and
a few other individual shelves of books.

Nibelheim Pet Shop~
~
It would appear that the recent increase in traffic to Nibelheim
has given rise to a pet shop being opened.  This is a newly built
shop but it has been constructed in a rustic design to match the
rest of the village.  Many different tame creatures sit in large
cages around the shop, just waiting for a new home.

small village nestled near the base of a large, dark, twisted
mountain range.  Not much can be seen of the village from this
distance except for a tall water tower in the middle of town.

Dusty Path~
~
A nondescript dirt path leads through an area of transition
from dry grassland to undulating foothills.  To the west, the
ground levels out into dusty plains.  To the east, the path
leads up a rocky hillside in the direction of a dark and 
twisted mountain.

Dusty Path~
~
Small hopping insects sun themselves in the middle of
this dusty path, abandoning their spot only when in danger
of being trod upon.  The path curves south and east, where
the plains start to transition into gently rolling hills
as a large dark mountain looms closer.

Dusty Path~

A dusty dirt path leads north and south through a wide
expanse of dry grasslands.  The constant hum and whine of 
insects floats upon the warm breeze while grasshoppers
jump from the path whenever anyone treads near.  Further
northeast a large, dark mountain range looms in the
distance.
