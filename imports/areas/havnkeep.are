a beach seagull~
A seagull flies about the cove.

Feasting upon the rich beaches of the Sword Coast has
kept this bird fat and happy.  However one cannot help
but wonder if perhaps the locals have had something to
do with feeding the animals here.

The Sentinel of the Bluff scans the horizon.
~
While some would consider this to be a meaningless
task, the people of Haven's Keep regard this as one
of the greatest honors that can be bestowed upon a
member of the guard.  As such this man is clearly on
the verge of retirement given his age.

Praetor~
The Guard of Gates, Praetor stands vigilant over the Keep.
~
For most of his long years Praetor has kept
a guarded watch on the gates of his homeland.
Scars web across his gnarled face, proving that
he has had need to defend his post on more than
one occasion.

Simion~
Simion, the Keep Greeter waves travellers through.
~
Though the guardsman outside keeps enemies at
bay, it is the job of Simion to welcome those
wanderers admitted to the Keep.  A young man
whose family served the Keep for generations,
Simion carries the same sense of duty as his
predecessors.  The shoulder length brown hair
and child like facial features have fooled a
great deal of people into believing he is not
a capable warrior.  Care to try?

Gloria, Priestess of Tempus~
A tall thin Priestess of Tempus presides here.
~
Built perhaps a little too tall for battle, Gloria
chose to dedicate her life to Tempus in other ways
than those most conventional within the clergy.  A
seasoned veteran in the ranks of Tempus' followers
she was assigned to Haven's Keep in an attempt to
find a perfect fit for this raven haired mistress
of battle.

A drunk staggers amongst the shadows.

The locals tell that this man originally came
from Baldur's Gate.  Why he is here now is up
to now a complete mystery.  Why the leaders of
the Keep have allowed him to stay is a larger
mystery yet.  The foolish grin his face wears
leads one to believe that his days are wasted
drinking within this alley.  The hard glint in
his eyes however, can't help but make on think
that perhaps something else is afoot.

Originally a priest of Tempus, he left the church
at an early point in his career to deal direct
homage in the fields of battle.  A man of about
fourty years of age, Keaton keeps no hair atop

Despite that one 'goblin burger' incident over
a year ago, Gristle usually puts out some very
good dishes.  People have been known to travel
great distances (over the next hill) to be the
first to try his latest and greatest.  Gristle
stands an almighty 5'3" tall and from the round
bulge in his midsection appears to enjoy trying
out his own dishes on a regular basis himself.

Lord of Haven's Keep earned his place by vote
of the support council.  Having worked his way
through the ranks of the guard, he is regarded
as one of the most legendary of diplomats and
politicians along the Sword Coast.  Though at
times offered larger appointments elsewhere he
has turned each down in favor of his homeland.

Dirt and rock gives way to soft yellow sand.  The Sea of Swords

maintenance.  The sweet smell of burning firewood drifts downwind
from a small, well built keep which sits due north on the cliff
overlooking the sea a great distance below.

In days of old, Haven's Keep served the Sword Coast
as a scouting outpost.  Having the greatest vantage
point in all of the region, they were charged twice
over with both the duty of being a self-sustaining
outpost as well as providing early warning to cities
around them in case of impending invasions.  Darkly
set into the high cliffs, it has housed many famed
warriors despite it's small size.

important members who fulfill the original purpose of the Keep.
Highly trained, and constantly honing their skills, this is room
where the preperation takes place.  Only the most promising, are
invited within this organization.  Their senses are brought far
beyond that of a normal human so as to carry out their constant
vigil flawlessly.  Simple and frugal, this room contains little
but a small desk, for the Bluff Commander to work at.
