{^B{6l{^o{6a{^m{6, {^T{6he {^H{6alfling {^A{6lchemist shuffles about, trying to prepare his next potion.{x
~
This short, pudgy slob is called Bloam.  A glob of some sort of
goop rests in his hair, and a healthy bit of dirt smudges his face. 
He shifts his attention toward you as he finishes straightening things
up, to present a crack-toothed smile at you.  He follows you about the
shop, constantly under foot, as he seeks to tend to your needs - a
little overzealously.

{7L{3o{*v{3i{*a{3t{*a{3r{*, {%M{*aiden {%O{*f {%P{*ain stands here, smirking at you.{x
~
The ultimate dominatrix, Loviatar dresses in revealing cuts of
leather and chains.  She smiles cruelly at you as you gawk at her
lovely feminine form, and attempts to lash out at you with her whip. 
As much as she likes your pain, she likes her own as well.  And the
shackles that bind her seem to give her great pleasure as they dig
into her flesh as she leers at you, malice gleaming from her shiny
white teeth and maddened eyes.  An Avatar of a deity this cunning,
maniacal, cruel, and insane is not to be trifled with.

{^M{6i{^s{6t{^i{6b{^o{6s, {^T{6he {^W{6eapons {^M{6aster sits here, snickering at you haughtily.{x
~
This man walks with an air of authority.  His long, trimmed beard
and deep voice add to his commanding demeanor, yet when he speaks his
voice also seems calm and reassuring.  His kindness is known
throughout the Harpers, and his gentle hand has taught all but the
most senior members of the society how to protect themselves in times
of trouble.  His eyes seem to look right through you as you approach,
both assessing your potential as a pupil and as an enemy in a single
glance.

{CK{ca{Ce{cr{Cv{ca{Cl{cd{Ce{cn, {CT{che {CD{cwarven {CM{cerchant{c smiles at you, displaying his wares.{x
~
This aging dwarf looks at you with a knowing gleam in his eye.  His
long, red beard runs down to his waist, and his thick, stumpy feet
scamper about as he fetches equipment of all varieties from his stock
room and the wall behind him.  He gives any equipment a potential
customer seems interested in to Mistibos, who then proceeds to make a
dizzying and effective display of its uses.  As you approach, a large,
bawdy grin breaks on Kaervalden's face, and he begins clearing a space
on the counter to place his best equipment.

{^W{6i{^l{6d{^a{6n, {^T{6he {^D{6ragon {^T{6amer stands here, prattling to one of his pets.
~
This ranger has a rather wild aura about him.  His hair seems to
possess a life of its own, sprouting out in random directions like a
star twinkling in the night sky.  His eyes glow with a fervent desire
that only he can fathom, and his skin almost seems as though it has
some bluish highlights...  Yet when you try to eye them directly, they
vanish.  As you approach the shop, he continues crooning to the
dragons in their stables, waving his hands as though leading a choir.

~
A tall elven figure stands before you, blocking your passage.  His
skin is withered, and the look of death hangs about him like a cloak. 
He wears voluminous robes to cover his old body, and you can see from
his sharp eye that he is watching your every move.  This keen
intelligence is used to protect the Harpers from invaders, and he
looks as though he loves his job.  As they search you, his eyes seem
to be going over one thing over and over: Friend or foe?  The faithful
sword at his side assures you that he is prepared to enforce whichever
decision he makes.

~
The night is cold, the winds are out;
There's naught but stars and clouds about,
So if ye would, pull down that spout,
And draw me off a pint of stout.
 
I'd offer silver, even gold
For brew to cut this bitter cold
It's not a night for man nor beast,
Save for the hops and brewer's yeast...
 
Alas, my purse is thin and slack,
But lend me coin, I'll pay it back;
Or take in trade my song of mirth,
For it's at least a dollar's worth!
 
I thank ye kindly in advance,
For stout to drink and pipes for dance
A thousand blessings on this inn...
I'll gladly stop this way again.

~
This balding adventurer retired from the wandering life of a Harper years ago.  Now, he tends the kitchen here, serves drinks, and in general continues to make himself useful.
He walks with a constant sneer about his face, and compulsively wipes his greasy hands on his greasy apron as he scowls at his clients.  While not unwilling in his service, he certainly seems increasingly unhappy and restless

he notices you and offers to help you find the book you are looking

harpers~
Some members of Those Who Harp can be identified by the magical silver crescent 
moon-and-harp pins they bear; but a Harper can otherwise be just about anyone from 
any walk of life.  They're disorganized, secretive, and tend to have many lone 
wolves in their ranks.  Most work informally as solo agents who never band together.  
Elminster (a founder of the Harpers) once differentiated the Harpers from other 
secret societies as the only group that "habitually worries about the effect 
of their actions on others."  Senior Harpers tend to want to change the world 
personally, immediately if not sooner.
 
Others have called them "the meddlers of Faerun," and the comment is largely 
correct.  All work for what they see as good (though individual Harpers often 
sharply disagree on just what "good" is), and most do so in a style that 
involves deception, misdirection, and covert action rather than open conflict.
 
{^The Harper Code{x is simply stated but hard to follow:  {6to work against villainy 
and wickedness, to keep folk free of fear and tyranny, to support law and order 
to gain peace wherever laws are just and fairly enforced, and to prevent extremes 
of power and influence and imbalances of wealth and opportunity.{x
 
In following these aims, Harpers do whatever must be done without thought of 
personal pride or comfort. They police themselves (traitor Harpers must die), 
are free to rebuke and disagree with other Harpers, aid other Harpers without 
hesitation or thought of cost (or expectation of payment), and try to record 
and preserve the past, accumulating written lore for all.
 
Some Harpers prefer to work actively in cooperation with other Harpers, 
following a hierarchy and long-range plans.  That faction is based in 
Twilight Hall, in Berdusk, and led by the half-elf bard Lady Cylyria.  
Others prefer to subtly manipulate events behind the scenes, practicing 
politics amid great secrecy.  Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun is the most 
powerful of these, and he and his followers are often abrasively at odds
with the other Harper branches.  The third sort of Harper prizes independent 
adventurers acting more or less as secret angents.  These agents are led by 
Storm Silverhand in Shadowdale, aided by her sister Dove Falconhand and 
Elminster.
 
In the Sword Coast North, Cormyr, and the Dales, most common folk see Harpers 
as heroes; in Amn, Tethyr, and Calimshan, they're considered no better than 
the Zhentarim and other sinister cabals.

I should address my family curse here. Since
it affects so much which I do. Somewhere in
the past a forefather had attacked an allie
in the dark and killed him. His Lord was
so angered by this that he cursed him and
all his children with having to think before
they do anything. In time it became that
even in combat you were distracted by thinking
about who to attack, how to attack, and even
when to flee.
 
The curse has made my life terrible. Watching
a friend in battle with one person is not
to hard a descision but when there are two
the curse gets stronger and it just increases
as the options increase.
 
I am a wanderer and explorer. I have walked on
paths which few have seen, and some which
are only visible to all now.
As part of my worship of Tymora I throw my
fate into her hands using the spell of
teleportation. She has shown me many secrets
this way. Some dangerous, some beautiful, some
just to see them.
 
-Bruce of the Purple Pimernel the Cursed

I was born a gnome in another land. I was a
good thief and was training to be an assasin in
my clan. During a training event where I fought two
wizards, something went wrong with their magic,
and I awoke here in Westbridge. Everything was so
strange. I was no longer a gnome and I found I
could use magic. The killing I once did had lost
it's flavor.
 
So while I explored this new land for a way home
I explored all the changes which I had experienced.
Magic was fun and working good was a rush.
And while I was raised to have no god, Tymora
showed me her powers here.
 
One day in the Market Square a God attacked a
gladiator and she touched him so that on his
countering the gods blow, it devastated him.
Then in my own works I felt her hands many times
winning when I should have lost, losing when
I should have won. And escaping death when
escape was impossible.
 
I watched the goings on around me here and discovered
the Harpers. I watched them and learned their
numbers and names and requested to become
one of them. And they accepted me.

past~
As a child Subzero was abandoned by his parents, left in a forest
to scavenge for food, learning how to survive with nature, and how to
co-exist with animals.  As he grew in age, he also grew in strength,
and in his need to find answers.  He then met a young man in his
travels, a young bard, but very wise in his age.  The bard inspired
him to join the Harpers.  For they might be able to help him find his
family.  As he slowly adjusted to way of the harpers, his skills
gained.  And the urge to solve the questions in his mind grew.  During
his training he met a man who taught him the ways of Istishia.  After
a short while, the lovely Iaki caught his eye, and after spending much
time together, they where wed.  Subzero, still searches for the
answers to his questions...

Leaves of all {-c{-o{-l{-o{-r{-s{x litter the floors and walls of this windy
passageway.  A cool {^b{6r{^e{6e{^z{6e{x flows through the area, and the light from
your torch seems to be somehow augmented by another light source of
magical nature.  All around you are signs of the forest and its
denizens, yet nothing shows itself.  As if sensing your intrusion, all
the animals have fled and left only the faintest noise in their
parting.  This noise comes clearer as you continue to make progress,
and eventually it becomes the crystal clear song of a {^h{6a{^r{6p{x.  Its
source, however, remains unknown to you.

Shelves stuffed to the brim with books, scrolls, and other oddities
line the walls of this room.  An old man with a shifty gaze shuffles
among them, keeping everything sorted and preserved.  Catalogs list
many lessons of the past, both from fallen civilizations such as
Netheril as well as lessons to be learned from vile nations such as
Thay.  Judging from the size of the room, it would seem that as you
walked it would get smaller.  Instead, as you peer from shelf to
shelf, the room seems to enlarge itself as vast vaults of knowledge
unfold before you within these musty tomes.  Exits lead to the south.

{^T{6urner{7 is dressed in a gaudy {3orange{7 shirt and bright {Bblue{7 pants.

what appears to be a new {&white{7 dress.  At their feet lies a {Rf{#l{Ra{#m{Ri{#n{Rg{7

{*Multiple candles spread their light through this cozy looking
office.  On the ground in the middle of the room is a large tapestry
with the {YM{yoo{Yn {*and {CH{ca{Cr{cp {*woven in it.  On this tapestry, almost in the
center of the room, is a large oaken desk.  Parchment, scrolls and
books are spread all over it.  On one of the corners is a goose
feather and a golden ink pot.  Behind the desk is a chair made out of
pinewood.  Along the northern and southern hall are bookcases keeping
books from all kind of origin, most of them containing bookmarks. 
Right in front of you, on the western wall, is a large painting of
B{wl{*acks{wt{*aff To{ww{*er.  To the left of this painting hang two finely
crafted staffs.  On the right side of it is a small wand-tapestry.

This breezy passageway has many old leaves strewn about the floor,
and the subtle scent of roses suffuses the entire area.  Leaves
continue to fall from the air, though there are no trees near by, and
you feel as if you are being watched.  With each step, a leaf crunches
under your heel, and the feeling increases.  Exits lie to the West,
North, and East.

save for plaques denoting the undead creatures of the {%M{5useum{x.  To the
west, the Anarchist Breweries of {%T{5orregiano{x can be seen, hard at work
producing intoxicating beverages.  And to the east an empty elevator
shaft in the city of {%Z{5ozo{x stands, almost a monolith of stillness save
for the cable that moves as the elevator makes its way from floor to
floor.

this room for years, awakening renewed in a new world of challenges. 
Looking about, you can see two men who seem to be doing just that. 
Their long beards mesh gracefully with the vines that run along the
floor here, and smiles play lightly about their faces as they dream
pleasant dreams that only a {^H{6a{^r{6p{^e{6r{x could conjure to mind.  The only

of the booth, examining the weapons and teaching prospective customers
how to use them.  He, too, looks at you from rugged eyes; seeming to

pleasant and enjoyable.  Exits lead to the south.

The walls of this corridor seem to shift constantly, as if in flux
with some divine energy.  Where the ceiling should meet the walls,
there is instead an empty space where the night sky shines down on you
instead.  Here, the moon shines brighter than in other spots of the
corridor, its full, bright orb seeming to watch you with a keen
intelligence only celestial beings can master.  The walls seem to
convulse, and grow wider with the presence of the full moon.  Exits

peaceful escapes to a simpler life.  Despite being indoors, the night
sky is visible through the roof of this room, as the walls seem to
dissipate and fade into nothingness at their tops.  The sky seems to
twinkle a bit more here, but nothing else significant presents itself
here.  Exits lead to the West and East.

Many altars to various gods lie sprawled about this room by a
careful hand.  Before each altar lies a small meditation mat, where
one may sit and clear one's mind and utter the proper prayer's for
each deity.  The walls are adorned by large tapestries, each depicting
events of the past.  One displays a scene from the Time Of Troubles,
and another shows a scene from The Weeping War and the fall of Myth
Drannor.  The altars and the tapestries with their scenes of the past
seem to give this room a divine aura, despite its cramped nature. 
Exits lie to the east.

A small door leads into this little alcove, where a surprised and
angry {3S{2t{3r{2i{3d{2e{3r{x greets you with a glare and a sword-edge.  The room is
covered in elven sigils and old arcanic wards, long since inactive. 
Leaves from the tree above litter the floor, and a small trap door is
set into the ground, leading to only the gods know where.  Exits lead
back Up into the tree above, or Down below into the unknown.
