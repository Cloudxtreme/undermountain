Path to a Cottage~
~
You continue walking along the path, which has now taken you closer
to a clearing.  The trees that have been surrounding the walkway have
thinned out, allowing you to see what is up ahead.  It appears to be a
cottage of some sort, not very impressive but quaint nonetheless.  To
the east you hear some faint rustling, and you can't help but look to
see what it is.

stone structure with ivy climbing the walls in abundance.  The front
door is painted a bright green to match the foliage growing out of the
numerous clay pots placed in nearly every window.  The front door
remains unlocked, encouraging all who come upon this place to enter
and make themselves at home.

with painstaking detail, thousands of ceramic tiles are arranged to
depict a flock of snowy doves flying through a {$blue{& sky.  You see two
exits, one leading west into the reception room, the other north to
the garden.  A winding staircase leads up to the second story.

Now you're standing in a brightly lit reception area, decorated in
hues of yellow and gold.  Ornate golden tables are circled by
comfortable looking matching chairs, upolstered in yellow velvet. 
Each table contains six place settings of delicate handmade china and
a golden champagne goblet.  Lilting harp music floats through the air,
creating a dreamy atmosphere.  An large area in the center of the room
has been cleared to serve as a dance floor, and above it hangs a
crystal chandalier, casting rainbows over the floor and walls.

You find youself in a small but comfortable sitting room decorated
in shades of lavender, light green, and grey.  The main attribute to
the room is a large tapestry hung on the north wall.  A plush couch is
placed in the center of the room, and to the side of it rests a table
with a chessboard perched on top, a game already in progress.  On the
east wall is a large window draped in some light green netting,
allowing the morning sunlight to filter through without causing a
glare.  The floor is created of the same tile as the front hallway,
only less ornate and using shades of grey and green.

You are standing in a quaint chapel, built especially for Hanali to
perform her weddings in.  Large, expansive windows hand-crafted in a
myriad of colored glass line the north and west walls, A small, white
marble altar is faced by rows of mahogany and rosewood benches. 
Flowers of every type and color in handblown glass vases adorn the
altar, along with a few tall, platinum candlesticks.  The flames of
the candles casts a warm glow over the room, creating a comfortable

here to the garden down below.  On the terrace rests a delicate
rocking chair, in which Hanali often sits and daydreams and watches
the sun set.  An closed door leads into the house, but it seems to be

the one outside.  Ahead you see a dark rosewood door, closed yet
unlocked.  The smell of incense wafts through the air, apparently
coming from the room ahead.  Back behind you is the landing where you

you have very little choice but to turn around and backtrack towards

Finally you find yourself in a clearing.  The ground is covered
with a soft layer of moss and grass, and delicate ivy vines climb the
slender trunks of the surrounding trees, reaching up almost to their
highest branches.  The roots from the trees rise up out of the ground
to form natural places for you to sit and rest.  Small animals skitter
around, running from hole to hole, obviously disturbed by your
presence.

~
{&Water drips off the walls and falls into puddles that gather on the
ground of this seemingly abandoned cave.  The walls glisten as dim
light from the small entrance shines in and illuminates the strange,
silver flecked stone.  The air smells musty and damp, tinged with the
odor of rotting flesh, and you feel the urge to step back outside to
spare yourself from the rank, unfamilliar smell.  As your eyes adjust
to the light, a few things catch your attention.  Suprisingly a small
bed of flowers grows here, unrivaled in its beauty.  Unfortunately its
pleasant smell is overpowered by the stench of death and decay,
eminating from an unseen source.

Kossuth's Test Area Two~
~
The path that you travel on is bairly visable.  A thick forest
surrounds you.  Trees that seem to reach to the sky are all you
notice as you gaze around the land.  Without warning you bang your knee
on a odd shaped log.

Kossuth's Test Area~
~
All around you are walls covered in blood.  No windows of
any kind make the room filled with darkness as you step
into a building from the outdoors.  As your eyes come into focus,
you notice a strange figure lurking in the shadows.  Many thoughts
cross your mind as to what this could be.
