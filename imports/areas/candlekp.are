guard candlekeep strong man muscular~
{xthe {2Ca{8nd{&le{8ke{2ep{x entrance guard~
A tall, muscular man stands in front of the door, guarding the entrance to {2Ca{8nd{&le{8ke{2ep{x.
~
{xThis huge man isn't a typical {2Ca{8nd{&le{8ke{2ep{x staff member... 7' tall, with bulging
muscles, his job is to keep the... undesirable elements out of {2Ca{8nd{&le{8ke{2ep{x.
 
He is covered with {!s{1c{8a{1r{!s{x and {!b{1u{8r{1n{!s{x, probably due to duels with wizards, angry
to be denied access.  Yet, his expression is serene, not angry-looking or
hateful.
 
For, he has found his place here, guarding the door to one of the greatest
libraries in the realms.
 
But, don't let his outer calm fool you...  he's always ready to stop those
who try to intrude on the tower.  And he isn't someone safe to mess with.
 
Tattooed into his left arm is the symbol of {BH{bel{Bm{x, the god of Guardians.

bella halfling chainmail~
{YB{ye{Wl{yl{Ya{x {YLi{ygh{Wt{yfo{Yot{x~
A halfling in glowing chainmail is reading a book here, her Mace of Disruption at her side.  She also has a glowing Holy Symbol of {YD{ye{Wne{yi{Yr{x around her neck.
~
The second halfling in the Company of Fools, Bella is the one who
originated the name, and is the least willing member of the group.  An
intellectual, she is not well suited to travelling with the Company,
which consists of, in her own words: 
{x 
"Darvin, a pyromaniac ranger who enjoys lighting squirrels on fire...
how he keeps his job, I have no idea."
{x
"Joe Stranger, a bloody stupid thief.  Does something in the air in this world
result in EVERY thief being a complete idiot, or just most?"
{x
"Baka, the cross-dressing elven princess who just happens to be the only
person in the world who is unbalanced enough to have a relationship
with Darvin... I'd hate to see the babies."
{x
"And Gerrard.  That crack mine explosion left him with the mind of a child...
which makes him a cute idiot, which is somehow more tolerable than a normal
one."
{x
Bella is, however, stuck with the Company, and resolves to make the best of it
by dipping into the group's portable hole bank now and then to supply herself
with the latest in literature.

~
Dibbler is an eternal in the universe.  Wherever there are people
with money, there will be those perfectly willing to sell them barely
edible hot meat products at inflated prices.  Of course, even charging
his exorbitant amounts on food, Dibbler barely makes a profit...  What
with advertising, and overhead, and market research, and product
placement fees, and labor costs, and so forth.  He's practically
cutting his own throat with each deal!

Susan is a plain-looking young woman.  Two things, however, are of
note.  First, she has fangs, if you look carefully enough.  Second,
she is wearing a black cape.  Not just a black cape, but one that
flutters ominously in the wind, and is a deep shade of black. 
Obviously very magical, but with only aesthetic enchantments.

darvin elf elven tall ranger~

A tall elven ranger stand behind the counter here, seeming rather nervous.
~
Darvin is the "leader" of the Company of Fools.  Well, he considers
himself the leader, but all things considered Bella is the one in
charge.  Partially because if people don't do what she wants she
either whacks them with a spiritual hammer, or tells Gerrard to whack
them with his not-so-spiritual hammer.  Both are good motivators. 
Darvin is a ranger who once poured a flammable healing potion onto a
squirrel and lit it.  The resulting explosion surprisingly did NOT
result in Darvin's dismissal from the order of rangers.  He, however,
has yet to live it down.

Gerrard is a man with a very interesting past.  As far as the
Company of Fools can figure out, he was once a miner at a very
secretive and unique mine on Faerun...  The legendary lost Great
Faerunian Crack Mine.  In the Great Crack Mine Collapse, he was one of
the few survivors, but clouds of the strange white powder found in the
mine had permenant affects on his mind.  He now sees things that
aren't there, talks to inanimate objects, and acts like a child...  A
really big, strong, friendly child...  With a giant warhammer and the
strength of a storm giant.  As should be obvious, the Company of Fools
spends much of their adventuring profits on repairing Gerrard's
various...  Accidents.

tonati girl young barkeep bartender~
{mT{Mo{Yna{Mt{mi{x~
A young girl stands behind the counter, polishing the glasses.
~
Tonati is a Planetouched young woman...  But planetouched in a
bizarre way.  She is the daughter of an aasimar and a tiefling.  An
unlikely pairing, which explains the glowing aura and the tail and
fangs.  She has incredible skills as a bartender, learning from the
owner of the Inn Formerly Known As The Smouldering Corpse Inn.  (Since
the room's centerpiece, a flaming mage that never seemed to go out,
flew away with a scarred man...  The name didn't seem to fit anymore.)
She also has a smattering of skill as an enchanter, creating all the
magical artwork to be found here as well as the guardian golems
outside.

This statue is of Oghma, who rarely graces mortals with
appearances.  However, this statue is of his most well-known form, a
dark skinned, handsome man in bright and sylish clothing, with a
tabard with projecting ornamented shoulderplates.  He is also wearing
a cummerbund that bears a painted scene of exquisite beauty on it's
medallion shaped buckle, and open-meshwork pointed toed boots whose
uppers end in crystal teardrops that dangle down almost to touch the
upraised toes.  The statue is also carrying a yarting of white snow
wood.

This statue is of Milil's most assumed form, a young, charismatic
male human with handsome features.  When in this form, Milil may be
either human or elven, but no matter the race he has a voice of
unearthly beauty.  He most commonly appears clean shaven, as he is on
this statue, with shoulder length brown or blond hair.  The statue is
dressed in the garb of a troubadour- the garb made of bright,
elegantly patterned cloth, and bearing gold and bejeweled clothing
decorations and jewelery.  In addition, he has a beautifully made harp
in his hands, and the statue is posed as if to begin playing a
beautiful song for you.

statue~
In this statue, Deneir is portrayed in the form he uses most, an
old balding sage with a huge flaring white beard and eyes of intense
violet.  His columinous robes are covered in glyphs and symbols that
have been hypothesized to serve as some sort of code to remind him of
events and pieces of information.  Rumors tell that they cause strange
and random magics to affect those who touch them, depending on what
Deneir thinks of the person.  In this caricature, several quill pens,
scrolls, and tomes, are "falling" out of a pocket in his robe, and are
actually floating in midair...  Held in place by a levitation spell. 
It is said that Deneir accidentally (although, he probably intends
this) loses scrolls, tomes, or quills wherever he goes.  The legends
say that mortals who recover these find them to be enchanted spell
scrolls, magical quills, tomes of magical power, or instructions on
how to create powerful magical items.

You are standing at the beginning of {gKn{Dow{Wl{Ded{gge{x {gS{Dt{Wre{De{gt{x, which was
made to symbolize the collective knowledge of {gCa{Dnd{Wle{Dke{gep{x.  The road is
paved with a staggering number of cobblestones arranged in neat rows,
almost too many to count.  They each have the name of a book and it's
author written upon them, in very small lettering, and in almost every
written language on Faerun.  {Ge{Cl{cv{Ce{Gn{x, {ygn{Wo{Ym{Wi{ysh{x, {Wdw{Darv{Wen{x, {rd{Rr{Yag{Ro{rn{x, and even

and preserved.

You are standing at the beginning of {gKn{Dow{Wl{Ded{gge{x {gS{Dt{Wre{De{gt{x, which was
made to symbolize the collective {gkn{Dow{Wl{Ded{gge{x of {gCa{Dnd{Wle{Dke{gep{x.  The road is
paved with a staggering number of cobblestones arranged in neat rows,
almost too many to count.  They each have the name of a book and it's
author written upon them, in very small lettering, and in almost every
written language on Faerun.  {Ge{Cl{cv{Ce{Gn{x, {ygn{Wo{Ym{Wi{ysh{x, {Wdw{Darv{Wen{x, {rd{Rr{Yag{Ro{rn{x, and even
{Dd{War{Dk{x {re{Rl{Dv{Re{rn{x can be found inscribed on the stones.  The scholars at
{gCa{Dnd{Wle{Dke{gep{x feel all {gkn{Dow{Wl{Ded{gge{x, be it good or evil, should be honored
and preserved.  
 
Both ends of {gKn{Dow{Wl{Ded{gge{x {gS{Dt{Wre{De{gt{x are called the beginning, since there
is no end to the {gkn{Dow{Wl{Ded{gge{x that can be found.

The corner of Knowledge and Wisdom is a grand place, flowers on all
four corners, planted in alternating rows of color.  Along all of the
flowers, benches are placed, a soft padding lining their seats.  Above
each is a lamppost, slender yet strong, the tiny bulb on the end
glowing with a faint light spell to provide a soft light for
illuminating the pages of books being read beneath, but not strong
enough to detract from the surroundings.  In the center of the
intersection is a simple plaque on a stand, curved into a dome and the
words forming an endless circle.  There is also a strange sort of
silence enchantment on the area, cutting noises down signifigantly.

a True Neutral Greater Power, who resides in the Outlands, in the
House of Knowledge.  Oghma's portfolio consists of knowledge,
invention, inspiriation, and bards.  He is allied with Deneir, Milil,
Gond, Mystra, Azuth, and Lathander.  His foes are Talos, for Talos
destroys everything, including knowledge, Mask, who hides the truth,
and Cyric, whose Cyrinishad twists the records of history to suit his

You stand in an unusually clean bar.  Most bars have signs of the
occasional brawl, but not this one...  although that is to be expected
from a bar in Candlekeep.  The back wall is lined with kegs and
flasks, each marked with a different symbol...  probably a sorting
system.  Along the walls are artistic renderings of the various
greater and lesser elemental planes, and most are bizarre and
magically animated to look like windows into the planes.  However, the
strangest sight is that of the barkeeper.  She is a young girl with
what appears to be the tail of a demon, and oddly coloured skin.  Her
physical...  differences do not detract from her appearance in any
way, however, and actually enhance it.

mob echoat $n {x
mob echoat $n {xYou take the glass and drink the {bw{Ba{Ct{Be{br{x down... a feeling

mob echoat $n {xas you feel the {bw{Ba{Ct{Be{br{x diffuse into you.  The taste... you
mob echoat $n {xknow from the instant it hits your tongue that all normal
mob echoat $n {x{bw{Ba{Ct{Be{br{x will feel gritty, and imperfect, now that you have
mob echoat $n {xswallowed the sample you were given.  The {bw{Ba{Ct{Be{br{x is crisp

mob echoat $n {x$I fills a small glass with some wine and slides it to you,

mob echoat $n {xsmiles.  '{mGulp th' whole thing down.  Enjoy.{x'
mob echoat $n {x
mob echoat $n {xYou do as she recommends, and nothing seems to happen.  However,
mob echoat $n {xperhaps a few seconds after you drank the mixure, a feeling not
mob echoat $n {xunlike an ogre smashing a warhammer against your head repeatedly
mob echoat $n {xmakes itself known, and the feelings in the rest of your body
mob echoat $n {xmake it seem like the Time of Troubles has set in again with
mob echoat $n {xunusual severity.  Just when you feel it is time to be judged
mob echoat $n {xbefore your god, the pain stops.  The sun shines.  You can hear
mob echoat $n {xthe rustling of the flowers outside, and feel the loving warmth
mob echoat $n {xof the sun... even though you are nowhere near it.  The day has
mob echoat $n {xsuddenly become much better than before.
mob echoat $n {x
mob echoat $n {xYou slide the glass over to $I, in a sort of daze, and she...

mob echoat $n {xand it slides across easily due to the {ci{Cc{ce{x.  You take it, and take
mob echoat $n {xa swig.  Immediately after recognizing the taste as the highest

mob echoat $n {xThe {cw{Cin{ce{x has formed a sheet of {ci{Cc{ce{x wherever it touched inside you!
