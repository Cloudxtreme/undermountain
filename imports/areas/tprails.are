second lord castle guard~
the Second Lord Of Vector's Guard~
A large castle guard stands here, keeping watch.
~
He looks somewhat big, but its only his armor.  He stands here infront of
the gates, holding a spear in his hand, and looking straight forward.  He
doesn't notice you are here.

warrior chaos~
The {RC{rh{*a{ro{Rs{B Warrior{x~
A Warrior of Chaos stands before you with his mace in hand.
~
This beast stands twice as tall as you.  Foam drips from its mouth
down on to its spiked leather boots.  The glare bouncing off of his
polished skull helm is almost enough to blind you.  He chuckles as he
swings his mace, wich is easily as big as you, around at his side. 
Propped in front of him like a huge iron wall is a massive shield,
emblazoned with five flaming swords.  The stench of this creature
alone is enough to knock you out.

Slaanesh~
A tall figure in dark robes lurks in the shadows.
~
A tall figure in black garb stands before you, blocking your
passage.  Its head hooded, you can only make out small features of its
face, but it does not look human.  A menacing feeling overwhelms you
as you gaze up upon this unknown creature.  As you look downward, more
toward your eye level, you notice a mithrill dagger hanging out of the
long sleeves of its robe.

The {RC{rh{*a{ro{Rs {yH{*o{yu{*n{yd{x~
A huge hound like creature foaming at the mouth is here.
~
This horribly ugly creature is foaming at the mouth and staring in
your direction.  Its fangs still fresh with blood, gleam brightly in
the light.  Small beaty red eyes, recesed into its skull, glare
hungrily at you.  The beast stands easily at 5 feet tall, on all four
legs.  Its fur matted closely to its body covered in dirt, blood and
flesh.

A heavily armored Knight of Chaos is here.
~
Arms pulsing and forming, a dark ruddy beast stands in front of
you.  Humanoid in shape and with the same amount of appendages, it
walks with a smooth gait, a glowing aura surrounds it's ever-changing
form.  On the head-like appendage, you notice 2 bright spots of
burning orange, it turns them towards you, you guess they must be
eyes...

Second Lord Myrddin
The TriPower is coming to inspect the fortress of Vector. We are going to
move the espers through the underground tunnels to your castle for holding.
Until the inspection and danger is over. From there we will move them back,
since they will want a trail with you, which removes more of the evidence.
All depends on this.

From: Dept Leaders Of The Legion
To: The Accomaxx Legion Devision
Legionaires,
You have been assigned to search the castle believe to be owned by
Myrddin, Ex-Second Lord Of Vector, who was lord under Ganon's Rule.
It is believe to be that Myrddin is the one holding the espers
prisoner, so The Legion is to get into the castle and find any
evedice against Myrddin or the Vectorian Empire. The Castle, is
believe to be located north of St.Plattsburg, so you will have to
walk to it. The Knights Of Myth Drannor asked to be a part of this,
so they are to be told to assemble in Torregiano Square. Godspeed.
<>
General Waur, 103rd Devision of the Legion

The Vectorian people has moved us somewhere.  We walked through a tunnel
underground for sometime now.  Now we sit in a dark, damp dungeon, waiting
some unknown fait.  I cannot write too long, but i think we're all going to
die.  I hear something of Magicite, and MagiTek Armor....  I'm not sure, i
hope someone or something can help up...

|   Known affectionately as 'Hara' by her friends,||

|friends.                                         ||
|   Born as Menhara Keldaria Nyx, she married Sfen||
|Brightlance some years ago. She is survived by   ||
|two children, Retyon and Sira, who are now under ||
|the tutelage and care of The Apostles of Sune.   ||
|   The exact cause of her death is not known, but||
|her body was discovered by The Lord of Fire,     ||
|Kossuth. That incandescent deity stated that he  ||
|cremated the remains, and would not comment      ||
|further. She will be missed.                     ||

|   All citizens of The Pax Faerunis said a prayer||
|recently for {WFyron{0, a Celestian mage who was     ||
|taken captive by followers of Cyric. His wife,   ||
|{WTezza {0(also a Celestian), said she believes that ||
|he must be dead by this time.                    ||
|   She stated that Fyron was tortured for months ||
|and finally killed out of boredom by his         ||
|kidnappers, but revealed nothing to his captors. ||
|Fyron is remembered fondly by his fellow         ||
|churchmates, and his fellow citizens.            ||
|   During his life, he served as a leader of his ||
|Church, the Celestian representative to The Pax  ||
|Faerunis, and acted as Westbridge's Chief        ||
|Reconstruction Architect.                        ||
|   All citizens of Westbridge are encouraged to  ||
|remember a fellow Paxian. Since his death, Tezza ||
|has become the new Celestian representative to   ||
|The Pax Faerunis.                                ||

|   An airship was found floating adrift along the||

|clothing, with a suicide note nearby.            ||
|Investigators found an open bottle of deadly     ||
|poison in the corpse's hand, and there is no     ||
|suspicion of foul play at this time. Xairin, a   ||

|found the architecture to be uninspired.         ||
|   The tower is a dull granite column rising up  ||
|from behind a circular wall with no windows,     ||
|battlements, or other outward ornamentation -    ||
|hardly worth any attention at all. The top of the||
|tower is a boring flat surface.                  ||
|   The garden surrounding it was its only        ||
|redeeming feature. When asked why his tower was  ||
|so bland, the testy archmage refused to comment. ||
|The reclusive sorcerer is thought by many to be a||
|member of the secretive governing body of        ||
|WaterDeep city: 'The Lords of WaterDeep.' -      ||

|   Westbridge and the other townships of The     ||
|Great Realms have reported a surge in cult       ||
|activity.                                        ||
|   'The Apostles of The Crypt', and 'The Jihad'  ||
|in particular have grown so large in numbers and ||
|organization that many citizens of Westbridge no ||
|longer think of them as cults.                   ||
|   Both organizations have engaged in apocalyptic||
|visions of doom, and the 'AotC's membership is   ||
|completely comprised of the undead! Another band ||
|of unsavory types, calling themselves 'Black     ||
|Roses' seem to be on the rise as well.           ||
|   Their exact goals and motives are unclear at  ||
|this time.                                       ||

|   After months of waiting, the TriPower Airship ||
|Authority stepped in on Westbridge's behalf, and ||
|helped in the construction of a new airpark.     ||
|   Many of Westbridge's bridges had been         ||
|overstressed by numerous airship parked beneath  ||
|them. Paxian engineers confirmed what the TAA had||
|reported: the bridges could not support so many  ||
|airships, and were in danger of collapsing!      ||
|   The new airpark can now accomodate all the    ||
|ships comfortably. Hathorne Judge, when asked why||
|construction took so long, replied {W"We asked The {0||

|As the sun bled golden orange across the horizon,||
|a small band of heroes gathered in Festival      ||
|Square, under the directions of Hathorne Judge.  ||
|Having lost track of time, Volgo and myself      ||
|arrived just as they set out with the sun in     ||
|their eyes.  There were heroes who represented   ||
|many different races and professions, all united ||
|under a single motivation: money and fame.       ||
|                                                 ||
|I never was very fond of my homeland ever since  ||
|King Dractax made it clear that he didn't want to||
|have anything to do with the Sagacus family      ||
|anymore.  The Vectorians could keep it for all I ||
|cared, but then Volgo made a convincing argument ||
|for me getting out more.  It would be an easy    ||
|job, good pay, and a little adventure in an      ||
|otherwise dull afternoon.  What could I say to   ||
|that?                                            ||
|                                                 ||
|As Volgo and I arrived to the scene, the clanking||
|of metal to armor rang across the valley floor.  ||
|A group of heroes composed of Tanaka, Castral,   ||
|and Grognard kept at a regiment of MagiTek       ||
|warriors who had engaged them from the west.  In ||
|a coordinated effort, they had them surrounded   ||
|and huddled in a corner, fending for their life. ||
|"We're missing the fun!" Volgo yelled as he made ||
|haste into the camp.  I followed closely behind, ||
|my pack laden with healing liquids.  We didn't   ||
|have to wait long, for just as we approached the ||
|center of the camp, two Magitek paratroopers     ||
|swooped in from the east.  Volgo raised his sword||
|to parry, and quickly connected the trooper with ||
|his other.  The second trooper could barely get a||
|hit in edgewise.  As we fought them off, Krogenar||
|came to join our group, and with his help the    ||
|second trooper was brought down with very little ||
|effort.                                          ||
|                                                 ||
|The fighting continued well on into the night.   ||
|At times one couldn't see who it was they were   ||
|fighting beside, only that they were fighting on ||
|your side.  Hathorne stood to the back, watching.||
|I glanced over every now and then to see him     ||
|crack an occasional grin, no doubt musing at how ||
|easy this was for all of us.  And we didn't mind ||
|it, as long as he stayed to pay us for our       ||
|troubles.                                        ||
|                                                 ||
|With no losses on our side, the valley was       ||
|cleared, and villagers soon began to come back   ||
|out again.  They were eager to meet those, which ||
|brought them salvation.  I did not stay to accept||
|the praise.                                      ||

|At night I walk the forest, still in awe after   ||
|these many years of what once was in the ruined  ||
|city.  The crystal spires still rise to the north||
|like so many hands reaching for help.  The       ||
|silence of my walk is frequently broken by the   ||
|screams of the demons within.  Their unholy      ||
|sounds echo through the forest like so many      ||
|piercing arrows, yet the owlbears and deer have  ||
|learned to live with it.                         ||
|                                                 ||

|                                                 ||
|Today, a Keeper named Libavius walks the         ||
|shattered streets of the city in search of a     ||
|relic known to be in the hands of an abishai     ||
|baatezu demon.  Though small, the black ones are ||
|very quick with their claws and can tear through ||
|flesh with ease.  Libavius refers to a copy of a ||
|map he has acquired from the archives, which     ||
|details the magnitude of the spell ward          ||
|ever-present over the city.  As he searches the  ||
|black, winged demons, he spots a hint of purple  ||
|in a large, hollowed out building to the north.  ||
|It is what he is looking for.  In the shattered  ||
|foyer, he becomes visible, and unleashes a       ||
|torrent of rocks from the heavens.  The baatezu  ||
|is felled quickly, and the pantaloons are in his ||
|hands, but a magebane quickly moves in from the  ||
|right to take its place.  Libavius doesn't stand ||
|a chance, and he knows it.  Turning to the broken||
|hallway, he makes a run for it, taking the blows ||
|from all sides as best he can.  As the end       ||
|approaches, he catches a glimpse of an           ||
|entranceway to his right.  This is his queue.    ||
|Uttering the words of recall, he makes his escape||
|through the weakened area of the ward, and is    ||
|once again safe in Westbridge with his prize.    ||
|                                                 ||
|                 *************                   ||
|                                                 ||
|We The Keepers have worked hard these many years ||
|to try and understand the past.  The need for    ||
|documenting the past and the present is great.   ||
|As our ranks have grown, so have our interests.  ||
|I am pleased to report that the knowledge base is||
|continually growing, and inclusive of many       ||
|aspects of the realms, including hero legends,   ||
|relic lore, and area geography.  It is very      ||
|satisfying to see individuals of many different  ||
|backgrounds working together toward a common     ||
|cause.  I cannot help but think of how similar it||
|must have been in that once prosperous City of   ||
|Beauty.                                          ||
|                                                 ||
|In recent months, we have shifted our focus      ||
|towards other areas of the world.  Something     ||
|great and wondrous is coming in our time, with   ||
|evidence of it ever-present in the world around  ||
|us. What we hold is the past.  What the future   ||
|holds remains an uncertainty.                    ||
|                                                 ||

|  A strange object was spotted hovering over the ||
|Sea of Swords. According to several eyewitnesses,||
|the object appeared for a brief moment, and then ||
|vanished. Witnesses all agreed on the shape of   ||
|the object.                                      ||
| "It was like a long stretched out egg." said    ||
|Leorn Samrin, a local farmer. The few people that||
|did spot the object agreed that it was incredibly||
|large."Big as a city! Well, maybe half as big as ||
|Westbridge - but I've only been there once, when ||
|I was a child." said Samrin.                     ||
| Others disagree on the nature of the object.    ||
|While some believe the flying egg is a messenger ||
|from The Rok, others contend that it's a small,  ||
|undiscovered moon, or perhaps an airship.        ||
| People who spotted the object also indicated    ||
|that the floating object was shiny, although     ||
|some argued that it was metallic, and others     ||
|insisted that the 'mystery egg' was coated with  ||
|some kind of liquid.                             ||
| While no one has evidence to prove any theory,  ||
|residents of New Thalos, and Westbridge scoffed  ||
|at the reports.                                  ||
| "An airship the size of Westbridge? That can    ||
|disappear? Don't make me laugh!" said Talorin    ||
|Heartsmorn - an airship captain.                 ||

| The Church of Nightmares was disbanded this     ||
|week, following a long struggle for survival.    ||
|Originally formed as a shrine to Nisstyre, a     ||
|group of loyal and faithful began their worship  ||
|and ravage upon lost souls around The Realms.    ||
|                                                 ||
|Seive and Sylvania joined nightmarish forces in  ||
|the start as leaders, soon forming an army of    ||
|elite adventurers.                               ||
|                                                 ||
|Notable early members included Rosso, Jehovah,   ||
|Tyler, Akihiro, Mikey, Odd, Astaroth, Arghaii    ||
|and Kirdan, who were to be later followed by a   ||
|fresh wave of new believers.                     ||
|                                                 ||
|The figurehead of the Church, Nisstyre, was      ||
|unavailable for comment - but some ex members    ||
|voiced their sadness at this week's shocking     ||
|events.                                          ||
|                                                 ||
|"It is the worst thing to happen in The Realms   ||
|in one hundred years," Vassal declared,          ||
|"the dreams of the mundane are once again safe,  ||
|and that is truly a shame."                      ||
|                                                 ||
|Seive, a founding member of the now disbanded    ||
|Church, said that he was 'saddened' by the       ||
|dissolution, but argued that it was for the best.||
|                                                 ||
|"The people that once made it grand are all gone ||
|or in different places now." he said.            ||
|                                                 ||
|When asked how he thought the Church would be    ||
|remembered, he felt certain that it would be     ||
|remembered fondly by former members, but that    ||
|most people who were outside it would have,      ||
|'mixed feelings.'                                ||
|                                                 ||

|Krogenar: 'Please, tell me about The EDS.'.      ||
|Alsin: 'As I've said before, we are an exclusive ||
|organization. Most members are criminals that    ||
|need a safe haven.'.                             ||
|Krogenar: 'And EDS provides this safe haven?'.   ||
|Alsin: 'Yes, all domains of the EDS are free of  ||
|the current societys laws that made us outlaws   ||
|and outcasts to begin with.'.                    ||
|Krogenar: 'What laws does the EDS have?'.        ||
|Alsin: 'No laws really, we consider it to be a   ||
|union of trust. All members are good friends of  ||
|mine. As for the citizens, they must show they   ||
|have worth to join.'.                            ||
|Krogenar: 'How many members do you have? How many||
|citizens?'.                                      ||
|Alsin: 'As per the last census, about 5 members, ||
|and 5 citizens, and two leaders'.                ||
|Krogenar: 'What area does the EDS control?'.     ||
|Alsin: 'We reside in the most remote locations of||
|these lands, known as Underdark, Darrowmere,     ||
|Menzoberranzan, Drow City, and any small         ||
|village'.                                        ||
|Krogenar: 'Was that your first choice? The       ||
|UnderDark?'.                                     ||
|Alsin: 'Yes, Underdark was my first choice, being||
|my homeland and a place still free from much of  ||
|the corruption'.                                 ||
|Krogenar: 'Does the EDS have any plans for the   ||
|future?'.                                        ||
|Alsin: 'We constantly are making plans, and we   ||
|are currently working on a large scale project.' ||
|Alsin: 'Although we do pursue open jobs such as  ||
|assassinations, destruction, and spying'.        ||
|Krogenar: 'Assassinations?! You spoke before, as ||
|though, the members of The EDS were unjustly made||
|into criminals by governments -  they sound like ||
|criminals who earned that title!'.               ||
|Alsin: 'In unjust societies we were given no     ||
|chances to earn a proper living and become       ||
|outcasts. For this reason, we had to enter these ||
|lucrative jobs to earn our living and get by from||
|day to day.'                                     ||

|Krogenar: 'But now, in your own city, you        ||
|wouldn't have to remain as assassins, or         ||
|thieves... why remain in those professions?'     ||
|Alsin: 'We remain in those profession because our||
|economy is not yet built to support us. In time, ||
|all members will retire, and even then, we will  ||
|still pursue these fields because we still have  ||
|some scores to settle with Society'.             ||
|Alsin: 'When we find true peace, and a passable  ||
|situation. I ensure you that not many will       ||
|continue such a rebellious lifestyle.'           ||
|Krogenar: 'So, the EDS is a collection of        ||
|assassins, thieves and rogues - with scores to   ||
|settle with society at large?'.                  ||

|Alsin: 'Fear? Fear is such a strong word. I would||
|say they might have a bit to worry about, but to ||
|fear, I doubt it unless they are part of the     ||
|cause, in other words, part of the common society||
|that outcasts our members.'.                     ||
|Krogenar: 'What 'bit' should they worry about?'. ||
|Alsin: 'As I said, we still have conduct commerce||
|in organized crime, and assassinations. In that  ||
|sense, if you are a governing official who has a ||
|price on his head, do not be surprised if the EDS||
|is there to claim the reward.'                   ||
|Krogenar: 'You mentioned a big 'project' that the||
|EDS is working on... what is it?'.               ||
|Alsin: 'That is pretty much confidential, and I  ||
|don't think that at this time it would be wise to||
|release that information to the public. But you  ||
|will see and hear about it, I can assure that. We||
|can just call it a formal establishment of the   ||
|EDS and it's capabilities.'.                     ||
|Krogenar: 'Anything else you'd like to add,      ||
|before we're done?'.                             ||
|Alsin: 'I'd just like to add, that the EDS is not||
|just for anyone, and that any person trying to   ||
|join should know that it is an exclusive         ||
|organization protecting the common "thief".      ||
|Krogenar: 'Are 'common' thieves allowed to join? ||
|Alsin: 'As citizens perhaps, but to actually know||
|of our organized plans only the few selected     ||
|members will know.'                              ||
|Krogenar: 'Thank you for your time.'             ||

| Recently, the following was announced to the    ||
| general public.                                 ||

| 3/4  page -        500 platinum.                ||
| 1/2  page -        250 platinum.                ||
| 1/4  page -        125 platinum.                ||
| 1/8  page -         75 platinum.                ||
|                                                 ||
| -with the notice...                             ||
|                                                 ||
|The staff of The Post retains the right to reject||
|any proposal, on any grounds, and no explanation ||
|is required. But generally, only the most        ||
|obnoxious advertisements will be refused.        ||
|                                                 ||
|Not long after, I received (to my delight) two   ||
|requests for advertisements. One of them, however||
|was a proposal for a full page image of a naked  ||
|woman. The client was willing to pay dearly for  ||
|the privilege, but I deemed it a bit much for a  ||
|newspaper, and made a public notice of the       ||
|decision.                                        ||
|                                                 ||
|Not long after, I received this letter, which I  ||
|will paraphrase.                                 ||
|                                                 ||
|"While I myself do not wish to spend my time     ||
|looking at naked images of women, some people    ||
|hold the naked human form to be beautiful -      ||
|Sunites for example, would not be offended by    ||
|such material. While I do not think that the     ||
|paper should have naked women on every page, I do||
|think your decision to ban all naked images from ||
|your paper is self-aggrandizing."                ||
|                                                 ||
|Point taken.                                     ||
|I've contacted the party who wished to publish   ||
|the nudity, and a nude woman may very well appear||
|in the next issue.                               ||
|                                                 ||

|*************************************************||
|A polite reminder that the sky really is falling ||
|                                                 ||
|It seems to me that there has been a distressing ||
|tendency of late to completely ignore the        ||
|celestial object known as Ragnarok. The Rok has  ||
|hung in our skies for years now, and our long    ||
|familiarity with it may yet be our downfall-     ||
|because if we allow familiarity to breed         ||
|contempt, and ignore the danger in our heavens,  ||
|we WILL be destroyed.                            ||
|                                                 ||
|            Make no mistake. Simply because we   ||
|have not seen a recent Ragnaroker invasion in    ||
|Westbridge, because few of us have been hit by   ||
|chunks of the Rok lately, DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE ||
|MENACE IS GONE. The Rok slowly descends on us,   ||
|ever preparing to unleash the fires upon the     ||
|three empires alike. Prepare. Defend. Pray. Put  ||
|your affairs in order, even. Whatever you choose ||
|to do about the threat of the Rok, remember this-||
|doing nothing has never been an option.          ||
|                                                 ||
|                          - Samith, Mystran      ||

|                                                 ||
|Although Jihad's members see the RoK as the      ||
|saviour of the world, I don't share their        ||
|optimism. They say, that after destroying the    ||
|world they will survive and build a better one,  ||
|with the help of The Apprentice. They might see  ||
|this as perfect...I see this as the end of the   ||
|world (destruction of the world sounds bad       ||
|enough) plus...it is said that Jihad'ers will    ||
|survive, ok...i don't know how BIG exactly the   ||
|huge slab is...but I don't think they have heads ||
|hard enough to survive the blow. To sum it up,   ||
|the RoK has to be stopped by any means (such as  ||
|the element swords) to prevent the destruction of||
|us and all we believe in. We don't need force    ||
|majore to make a better world, why not start from||
|within ourselves to do that?                     ||

[*]----------------------------------------------------[*]
{x  Several days ago the Judge Corperation made its announcement
of what this years Waterstock Competition would be like.  After
several meetings of the WBA Arena Board, it was announced that
Capture the Flag would be this years choice, except using their
specialized arena.
{x
{x  Built within the WBA Battle Gardens in Torregiano is the arena
that will be used, known as "The Gorge".  This massive arena
features two fields with bunkers, guard posts and purchasable
guard mob pets.  The arena layout is specifically made for war.
{x
[A little OOC here..]
{x
{x  The arena features two large fields with bunkers, which contains
healing pools, a shop providing supplies, and a pet shop.  The
two fields are seperated by a large gorge, connected by a single
rope bridge in the middle.  Paths lead down from the fields into
the gorge, which contains two shores and a river.
{x
{x  The arena is setup with "Spy" rooms, which display something
going on in another room (used for arena viewing mainly).  On the
field several towers watch the "entrace" rooms from the gorge
floor below, and one tower watching the rope bridge.  On the bottom
of the gorge is "enterable" grass, which goes to a single spy
room, allowing people to hide in the grass.  The river can only be
crossed with "a boat" located somewhere in the field.  Access to the
river can be made, but you will recieve heavy damage due to the quick
current and jagged rocks.
{x
{x  The pets within the pet shop are not made to inflect damage, but
are setup with unique mprogs to detect people.  Meaning you may
purchase these pets, and place them on the battle field in certain
locations to detect "invaders" entering your zone.  Flags will be
placed within the bunkers.
{x
{x  The game will vary depending on the time spent per round.  If
the rounds tend to be "quick" then the event will be held a certain
way, like best 3 out of 5.  If the rounds tend to be several hours
long, then we will probably only hold one or two.
{x
{x  More details to unfold as time goes on.  Waterstock is held either
a couple of days before or after actual New Years.

Before The Makou Reactor~
~
The awe of it, standing very tall in the air (about 100 feet) a
large iron tower stands....  You reconize it as a Makou Reactor.  You
see Mahn'Tor Citizens working on it, building it...  There is no sign
of the 4 Bars Of The TriPower, which is usually seen on all Makou
Reactors...  Painting in rought lettering on the side, is the owner of
the reactor..

mob ECHO Kefka walks out of the shadows, laughing...
mob echo {MKefka says {x'{mWell well well, a little party...{x'
mob echo Kefka peers behind him.
mob echo {MKefka says {x'{mI have a new playmate for you{x'
mob echo Kefka walks back into the shadows.
mob echo From the front of the ship, within the darkness, a loud,
mob echo horrid sound echos up through...The room begins to fill with
mob echo a dark, smelly black smoke. The sound of metal on metal
mob echo follows, with this roaring noise (resembling a diesel engine).
mob echo The room flashs as the beast blows fire from an orface.
mob echo The beast comes into the light, and you see, WarHammer, riding
mob echo A large Magitek Armor. The thing roars again, and smoke
mob echo pours out from a smoke stack.
say Foul Beings....PREPARE TO DIE.
mob echo The beast roars again, and leaps at you.
