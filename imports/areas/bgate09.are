overweight bartender~
Callahan~
An overweight bartender smiles behind his cigar.
~
A friendly looking fellow, he is large and jolly looking.  His eyes
twinkle and his lips are more often than not turned up into a grin
behind a fat cigar.  Red hair covered his head faintly, thin on top,
and laugh lines crinkle and dance around his eyes.  He wears an apron
around his waist and a casual shirt.

a kind woman~
A kind, elderly woman rocks in her chair.
~
Unassuming, she sits in her rocker with a blanket folded over her
legs.  Her eyes are a friendly green, her hair grey and wrapped in a
bun at the back of her head.  Wrinkles crease her once-smooth skin,
and there is a weathered look to her.  Her hands move with confidence,
the sign of her ability as a healer.

a young man~
Standing behind the counter, a young man looks bored.
~
Barely out of his youth, he looks somewhat anxious and awkward. 
His body is well built, though he carries a little more weight than he
ought to.  A bored expression in his brown eyes, he stands with his
back against the wall, arms crossed.  A tousled black, his hair is in
disarray, shaggy and messed.

the barkeep~
A grizzled man stands behind the bar.
~
The swagger in this man's step and the cut of his jaw make him an
opposing figure.  Black stubble covers his face in a short beard, and
a scar runs above his left eye.  Wearing breeches and a sleeveless
shirt, his muscled arms are visible, revealing the ornate tattoo on
his upper right arm.  This man was once a sailor, and a brave one;
there can be no doubt of that.

young woman apron~
Therese~
A young woman in an apron stands here, humming to herself.
~
Her blonde hair pulled back into a bun, a few strands have fallen
loose, floating around her heart-shaped face.  By appearances, she
could be no more than 25, her skin smooth and delicate, her hazel eyes
shimmering with optimism.  She is of slight build, though a few extra
pounds cling to her; she is neither fat nor thin, and seems content
with that.  Wearing plain clothes, an apron is tied around her waist,
smeared with dirt and flour.

the barkeep~
A lanky, wannabe sailor stands behind the bar.
~
He is a skinny stick of a man, face dotted with the scars of acne
in his youth and a nose that looks too large for his face.  Blonde
hair sits in a mat on his head, tugged to the side in a poor combover.
Meticulate, his clothes are a sailor's outfit a few sizes too big,
likely bought for too much platinum by a passing ship worker.  He
fidgets under the gaze of most in the tavern, moving awkwardly behind
the bar.

A dwarf with a menacing look stands behind the bar.

Muscular and large, he is not tall but he has a good deal of
strength.  A thick beard hangs from his chin, and bushy eyebrows sit
over his dark, menacing eyes.  His bald head is kept bare, a scar
crossing over his left ear.  Behind the bar, he stands on a raised
platform that gives his sight over the bar and across the tavern.

A single customer sits in the corner, looking depressed.
~
With maybe 20 winters behind him, he is a man with the look of a
boy.  Stick thin and too tall, his arms are gangly and his face narrow
and pale.  He coaxes a large drink, drowning his sorrows in ale and
looking despondant.  There is a glaze to his eyes that betrays the
many drinks he has already had.

Long hair hangs in strings below his hat, falling just past his
shoulders.  His nose comes to a long point and his smile is broad and
toothy.  Calluses coat his fingers, and he wears a baggy tshirt over
tight jeans.  The scent of pot smoke hovers around his subtly.

seems to barely be breathing.  Her brown eyes are filled with a
mixture of fear and excitement as she watches everyone who enters the
room.  Flushing, her pale skin turns red, and a single strand of blond
hair falls in front of her eyes.  Pulled back, her shoulder-length
hair is pulled back tightly, revealing slightly pointed ears.

~
Clad in breeches and a baggy man's shirt, she hardly looks a lady. 
Her raven hair has been pulled up into a severe bun, tied with a
strand of leather, and a single loose strand has been tucked behind
her ear.  Emerald eyes bore into those around her, keen and alert,
though she smiles casually as she speaks.  She is muscular and well
built, femininity mostly lost to her lifestyle.  Calluses adorn her
hands, and she gestures with them emphatically.

She looks like an elegant teenager, standing just over four feet
tall with the filled out figure of an adult.  There is a gentle curve
to her stalky figure, the shape of her hips and the rise of her bust
both distinctly feminine despite her broad shoulders and thick limbs. 
Her feet are large and broad, her hands slim but her fingers stubby. 
Falling in long, tame curls, her black hair accents her clear, pale
skin.

Little can be seen of this man, huddled in a brown cloak and
sitting in the shadows.  A strand of long, silver hair falls from

hunches over to prevent a true gauge of his size.  As patrons pass, he
gives no sign of paying any heed to them.

isn't much different from tree bark, and his skin is ruddy and
unmarred.  He folds his bare arms across this chest when there is no
mug in his hand, feet kicked up on a nearby chair.  Slight bags hang
below his blue eyes.

The atmosphere of the Blade and Stars is a merry one.  At all times
of day, visitors and locals alike can be found scattered around the
large room, talking and drinking.  Much laughter fills the air, along
with the smells of food and, at night, the crackling of a fire in the
fireplace.  Tables are scattered around the room, some empty.

A long bar stands near the wall, a cigar box sitting at one end and
various bowls of peanuts dotting its length.  The scent of a pungent
cigar hangs in the air; it overpowers the smell of alcohol and is like
few cigars known.  No mirror hangs behind the bar.  Instead, a
backwards clock is on the wall, ticking the seconds away.  Faded on
the floor is a scuffed chalk line.

rises up to the second floor.  Wrought of iron, it is skillfully

The floor is strangely clean despite the bowls of peanuts that sit
on nearly every table.  Glasses clang together in toasts and voices
rise and fall as conversations carry on, and there is much laughter in
the air.  On the wall hangs a dart board, darts sticking out at
awkward angles; the tables part to give players room.  A narrow
chalkboard hangs beside the board, but does not look often used.

The Gatehouse Tavern~
~
Built into the south east tower of the Baldur's Gate city wall is a
small old tavern.  The tall oak beams that run accross the ceiling
give an old farmhouse style theme to the tavern.  There are several
old fashioned sets of tables and chairs set out where the old folk of
the tavern can sing old songs, drink and be merry.

Ye Olde Inn~
~
Small and cozy, this inn is more a small home than an inn.  The
walls are decorates with tapestries and the furniture is hand-carved
wood.  A circular knit rug lays on the floor, dark green and brown,
giving the room an earthy feel.  Two rocking chairs and a couch all
face each other, and a long table at the side of the room serves as a
counter.

An open doorway leads between the main room and the bedroom.  On
the wall are tapestries similar to those in the other room, and a rug
on the floor looks to be made by the same hand.  A window opens out
onto the street, covered with homemade curtains.  Bunkbeds stand on
two sides of the room, snug against the walls.

An Abandoned Tavern~
~
This tavern has long been abandoned.  The tables are covered up
with old sheets, the chairs haphazardly stacked on tables, or broken
on the floor.  There is a bar but nothing is left but empty bottles
and broken glasses.  Perhaps the tavern went out of business because
of the foul smell coming from the sewers, or because of the violent
flaming fist soldiers stationed accross the road.

The first sight newcomers to the inn see is a huge painting of a
mermaid smiling coyly on the far wall.  Painted skillfully, it waves
coquettishly across the room from its spot lounging on the rocks by
the sea.  The room, filled with tables, is dimly lit and smells
faintly of fish.  Despite being in the upper half of the city, it is a
favorite of sailors, drawing them from the harbor.

A tall bar is set up by the wall, racks of glasses standing tall
behind it.  In the center of the racks is a long, wide mirror; a thin
shen of dust covers it, marked with fingerprints and other scuffs. 
Stools line the front of the bar, and napkins are spread haphazardly
over its surface.  The floor is mildly sticky from spills not yet
cleaned up.

Booths are tucked into the corner, a light hanging over each table
and casting dull light.  In times past, this may have been a place for
a romantic interlude; now, the seats of the booths were ripped and the
tables dirty.  Still clinging to its former life, beautiful wood
carvings of the sea hang on the wall above each table.

The famous mermaid painting hands on the wall here in all its
glory.  At close inspection, the signature of the artist can be seen
in the bottom corner, though it is too scribbled to be legible.  On
the other wall of the corner a large, mounted fish has been hung, a
tiny bronze plaque announcing its owner and size.  A few tables stand
here, covered in full and empty drinks, the chairs scattered
haphazardly.

A wide archway opens in the wall here, leading further into the
building.  Tables are offset to each other, leaving just enough room
to slip through, though chairs have been discarded and some toppled in
the way.  Overhead, one of the lights is out, the others left to fend
off the shadows that gather close.

Tables and chairs are crammed into this corner, giving patrons
little elbow room.  Fishing trophies hang on the walls, and empty
glasses are scattered on both the tables and the floor.  Someone has
left out a decimated bowl of beer nuts, the remaining contents
scattered everywhere.  One of the lights overhead rocks gently, caught
in the breeze from a crack in the wall.

Set apart from the ruckus of the pub, a counter stands beside the
wall.  Unlike the disarray of the large room, it is neat and tidy
here, piles of papers meticulously kept on a desk behind the counter. 
Closed doors lead in two directions, and a stairwell leads up to the
second level.  A rope blocks the stairs off, and a sign hanging from
it directs people to the counter.

Shelves are everywhere, holding every size and shape of box that
could fit.  Piles of spare sheets and pillows are in one corner, and
an open box of candles sits on a shelf near the door.  Toward the back
of the room, larger boxes sit on the floor, just enough room left
between them to walk.  A single light hangs from the ceiling, dangling
precariously on a single cord.

a washbasin, a mirror hanging above it, and a cloudy, transluscent
shower curtain separates off the tub.

The landed on the spiral staircase is a subtle one, easy for drunk

the north, the Elfsong Tavern stands, its doors opening and closing to

gate on one side to allow the bartended in and out; there are no seats
around it.

One of the favorite spots for adventurers to take a load off, this
place is roudy and loud.  The tables, covered with an assortment of

and a low bench runs against one wall.  On the floor is a dark,
unidentifiable stain.
