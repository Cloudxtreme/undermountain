The Magitek's Facility, the place where the Magitek Army runs, lives and
dwells.  You enter this iron catacomb, which is very dull.  To the north you
see the command's office, and to the south, the bunking area for the Magitek
Warriors.  A hallway extends a bit to the east, and through a door, you can
see a very large building connected here.

papers and books stacked all around.  On the walls you see plans for the new
Magitek Armor, a type of device that seems to run on Espers.  Ganon's name
appears at the bottom.  A desk stands in the middle, also cluttered with
stuff, that is really all that is in here.

The tunnel here is long and dark.  Only a torch hangs on the wall,
giving off a little scrap of light.  The floor is made from stone, and
along the edges of the wall a little ditch lies, carring the dripping
water away from the tunnel.  The tunnel goes north and south.
