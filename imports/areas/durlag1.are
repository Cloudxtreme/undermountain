The Phantom Librarian~
The Phantom Librarian stands here among the books.
~
This phantom was humanoid in another life, as evident from its
humanoid form here in the afterlife.  Most likely, it was summoned by
Lord Khelben himself from the torments of the nine hells to serve him
in peace and in solace.  It looks like a formidable adversary, so you
should use care if you choose to challenge it.

A {rforeign {gprophet {xstands here, spouting off some obscure prophecy.
~
His face is wrinkled and sunken, almost ghastly.  He has long,
stringy hair, balding in spots and topped off with a pointed hood.  He
holds a gnarled walking stick and leans upon it for support.  His
robes are less robes than dirtied rags, torn at the feet where he has
snagged and trampled upon it.  He is dirtied from head to sandals, and
smells as if he hasn't touched water in many weeks.  When he speaks,
he does so with a cracked voice, from much shouting that those of his
profession do.

He is an elder gentleman, well dressed and sporting a smile from

interesting is that he is one of the immortal servants, such that his
mortality is pardoned for his tenure here in the spindles.

dialogue~
There can be no doubt that in that part of the heavens which has
been deemed the purest and serene of all, can be no less than
a fate forged from chaos. These imperfections can be seen with a
most peculiar instrument called a telescope and I profess these
words to be product of genuine and unbiased observation.
{x
This telescope stems from the ingenuity of dwarves and mankind
by the will of Oghma and the artifice of Gond. This device
is constructed of a long cylinder fitted with many lenses made
of grinded quartz, the less opaque the better. I have come upon
several different examples, some crudely made with wood, while

dialogue~
The gods imprint their grand blueprint on everything, for these
same features adorn many other orbs I have viewed.  All but one,
which I dare not set another eye upon for fear and distrust 
beheams my very soul.  It is the accursed orb of Ragnarok, which
flames and hovers precariously above our world.  The landscape
is red with hellish inferos so great that they seem to consume
upon the very rock itself. I have seen the faces of twisted souls
and tormented beings that I cannot describe for fear of a similar
fate. It is this unholy sight that lends itself to question the
very heart of evil, which for many centuries has been accredited
to dwell in the very bowels of our own world.
{x
And then there is the orb of life itself, the sun deemed perfect
and unblemished from the hands of our own greater gods. It also
stems from chaos, for with minor tinkering to my own telescope,
I have fitted upon the lens a filter of sorts fashioned from the
dark crystals of Agnar. This allows the sun itself to be viewed
with little fear of blindness, and upon its acclaimed flawless
surface, I have beheld many times spots of incongruity. They are
dark and always in the same radial of the orb.
{x
I have come to the conclusion that this is the result of some
great war of godly magnitude. Even powerful mortal magics cannot
do such damage, and if nothing more, this stands as a testament
of the awe inspiring power of our greater gods. I deem it not
unlike the darkness which dwells in what we'd like to think be
a pure and proper heart, as an edifice of powers beyond our
comprehension, yet within our very substance.

These accounts herein are of those of mine own eyes or spoken
by those who witnessed the climax and aftermath of a war waged
by the dark race known as the orcs against the City of Splendors
in the Year of the Black Horde. Not even by the hand of Beshaba
would I have believed such sights I beheld with mine own eyes.
To the north they came down upon the city, first in small groups
which were easily held back by our fortifications, but with
increasing days, they grew in numbers. Two weeks we fought back
those few who scaled its heights as crudely crafted rams worked
at the gates and sides day and night. Then they came in force
out of the mountains and hills like a black deluge of ungodly
mass. It came upon us so fast that we were hardly at means to
recover against it, but we did.  My friend and companion,
Ehtaine, was with me upon one of the northeastern towers as we
worked at the masses first with our arrows, then with anything
we could find to hurl upon them. This went on for many weeks,
then weeks became months.  During the night, it was like
warring the shadows, for one could only hear the infernal yells
of their infantry and the crushing of bone and flesh from the
bricks we hurled upon them. Ehtaine and myself sacrificed our
hearths for the good of our city, as many others did for their
salvation. There were spans of several days when the hoards
would back down, but they always came back in force, and we
dreaded every moment up to the point when their war cries 
carried over the hills once again. I cannot describe to you the
horror of the townspeople and of the many who died by their own
hands. The orcs would defile all they kill, including those of
their own, for nothing escaped their treachery. Approaching the
third month, supplies and water ran short. We could not drink
from our freshwater sources, as the orcs had defiled them with
excrement the first week of the seige. We prayed to all gods we
held dear for rain, especially to Istishia, Lanthandar,
Sylvanus, and even Umberlee for shifting rain clouds. The rain
came, but it did not last long, and we found ourselves at
constant kneeling to the powers that be to grant us asylum from
this place. Who knew that of all that would bid an answer to
our call, Akadi heard our plea, and brought us the winged
griffons which would send us over the hordes to safety.

{xFor many years, westbridge has been the central hub of commerce
and conversing among all adventurers, and yet the reasons aren't
readily noticeable.  Indeed, there are many businesses and places
to go inside the well-fortified city walls. There is little in 
the way of danger to worry about within, and one could live very
well their whole lives inside, even the eternal elves, who have
been spotted along the streets. The city lies within walking
distance of several other settlements, including the famed city
of Torregiano, regarded as one of the most technological cities
in existence, next to Figaro Castle, and rumors of the isolated
cities of Heifong. To the south, one can find the small Dale of
Stonebow and west the village of Hilp and the Titans. The two
Thalos' lie to the far east and southeast, and looming right
near her eastern walls lurks the Tower of Fanatics.
{X
{gOn New Thalos:
{X
{xThe resettled Thalos of the new era marked an establishment of
many guilds within her city walls. Ruled by a sultan, the city
lies on the outskirts of the Sands of Sorrow, where the nation
of Figaro holds jurisdiction. The port city of New Thalos has
much to offer to the shipping industry, as there are always 
goods coming in and out by way of the Sea of Swords to the east.
This is a far from the two cities which border it:  The rich
and advanced hub of the Tripower known as Torregiano, and the
poor, decreptic settlement of Zozo to the northeast. There are
also dangers to be on guard against while exploring the city,
for the thieve's guild holds strength there, and rumored to be
within the sewers.
{X
{gOn Zozo:
{X
{xThis town stinks of many foul odors. Drunks roam the streets,
and the few established shops sell mainly weapons and other
outlawry. Set at the center of the city is a large, plain
tower where strange things are reported as being there. But of
all the oddities of Zozo, none can be more strange than the
strange railway of the undead, which resides to the east. Once
one steps foot upon the train, they cannot leave, and many have
lost their lives on foolish pursuits of curiosity.

to the current world.  Indeed, it is made possible by the wonderful
contraption known as the Airship. Like a sailing vessel, these
mammoths tread the clouds and range from relatively small, single
seater models, to large cruisers that are used for high cargo
capacity and for protecting one's own interests.
{X
To the distant Ishtar Sea, one can still find the fortress island
of Accomaxx, which is inhospitable for landing a sailing vessel.
However, the airship enthusiast can afford another option to land
directly upon the island.  It is not unlike any fortress known,
highly advanced in armament and in modern luxury, and can be an
interesting place for all interests.
{x
Turning further southeast, one can find Paradise Island precariously
set among the Sea of Swords.  This island truly is paradise, with
beautiful sandy beaches, vegetation, and a tropical climate not like
any known throughout the realms. Accomidations are also luxurious, 
for a price of course, but today's traveler can easy afford the
modest price for anything but modest arrangements.  As all part of
the island are a marvel to behold, one does not have to bother with
asking for a room with a view.
{X
If adventure, excitement, and danger fit one's agenda, turn your
compass towards the likes of Heifong III, a pirate capital that is
only accessible by means of airship. I warn you in advance: the
city is not for the faint of heart, for danger lies around every

It is the opinion of modern physitians that this way of making up Medicines
was invented only to deceive the pallat, that so by swallowing them down whole,
the bitterness of the medicine might not be perceived or at least it might not
be unsufferable, and indeed most of their pills though not all are very bitter. 
{x
I am of a clean contrary Opinion to this, I rather think they were done up in
this hard form that so they might be the longer in digesting, and my opinion
is grounded upon reason too, not upon fancy nor hear-say. The first invention
of pills was to purge the Head, now as I told you before, such Infirmities as
lay neer the passages, were best removed by logiston, because they pass to the
grieved part soonest, so here, if the infirmity lie in the head or any other
remote part, the best way is to use pills, because they are longer in digestion,
and therefore the better able to call the offending Humor to them.

antipathy, you would not understand a word of it, they that are fit to make
physitians may find it in the treatise: all modern physitians know not what
belonged to a sympathetical cure, no more than a chocobo knows what belongs to
flats and Sharps in music, but follow the vulgar road, and call it a hidden

Magic is, paradoxically, both simple and complex.  The complexity lies in the
difficult mental disciplines that must be mastered, and the lifetime study to
find "true," usable, knowledge.  The actual use of magic is easy, once one has
learned how.  To utilize magic, the adept must learn mental disciplines and be
able to rid oneself of distracting thoughts and emotions, to concentrate upon
one thought, one sharp focus, in order to direct the Weave.  To be effective,
an adept must be able to take this art of concentration one step further and
be able to relax, clear his mind, and focus under the most distracting of
conditions.  It is a meditative art that must be learned to perfection before
an approach to the magical processes can be attempted.

tomorrow will bring a new day of hope; one of triumphant victory

I sit here alone, staring into the white ridden coal's of a fire
I care not to stoke, for my bones are to damp from the rain which
pounds down upon my aching shoulders. I care not, for this is the
life of a warrior - a warrior destin for damnation..... Perhaps
tomorrow will bring a new day of hope, one of triumphant victory
or magnificent passion. For either would surely brighten my soul
and give me reason to live on.

kenku~
{8[{cExcerpts from the First Section{8]{x
{x
The Kenku are a strange race of humanoids that are blessed with
the ability to fly. They resemble bipedal birds with humanoid
arms, yellow eyes, and often brilliant plumage. Typically male
kenkus are adorned with the brighter blues, greens, reds, and
yellows in varying patterns, depending on their ecology and 
hereditary traits. There is the occasional jet black kenku male,
but they are considered rare, and in some cultures, servants of
the dark gods. Female kenkus always have ruddy colored plumage,
such as rusty brown, gray, and often times, black.
{x
They walk with their wings folded behind them, and many times
are mistaken for other humanoid races at a distance. They prefer
to wear clothing, including hats, boots, and whatever else they
can fit around their kenku physique. They are very curious
adventurers, and many stories circulate about kenkus who have
gotten into quite a mess over their curiosity. They are also
weary of others, as they feel trust must be earned, not given.
They are generally friendly, going out of their way to interact
with other races in the interest of learning more, and many have
the gift of entertaining others with jokes, tricks and the like.
{x
They are of course, natural airborne creatures, and use this to
their advantage in battle. Topped with their psionic abilities,
kenkus can make formidable allies or opponents. They are
also natural diplomats, having the ability to communicate with
most all other races, in verbal, sign or mental forms. More
often than not, this is taught at a very young age, though a few
kenkus grow up isolated from their own, and never realize this
ability to its fullest.

He awoke to a strange sound, not coming from the forest around
them.  The fire had long since died out, and Caerin was still
fast asleep amidst her makeshift bed of leaves. "Was it a dream"
he thought as he tried to perceive the sound he heard. Nothing.
{x
The wind rustled some trees, but was silent once more. As Levasi
rested his head once again upon the log, he heard the sound again,
this time recognizing it's origin.  Quickly, he stood to his feet
and strapped his swordbelt around his waist. Unsheathing it with
care, he ducked behind a large tree and waited. As Caerin slept,
he watched as they flew around slowly to her left, then to her
right, treading with care so as not to awake her.  Levasi smiled
and watched as the group of faeries prodded her gently with a
stick, and then proceeded to circle the campsite for signs of
others. 
{x
After several minutes of this, they began to gather up all they
could carry of the few trinkets which caught their eye.  They
took everything that wasn't fastened down, and then some that
were, including the buttons from the garments Caerin left 
hanging near the fire. They were so busy in their work, that
none of the four realized that Levasi stood in the shadows
holding his jacket slightly open. As they worked at the threads
on the garments, Levasi quickly rushed in to capture them.  Two
were quick enough to escape, but two struggled beneath the thick
leather of the jacket, yelling for their freedom. Caerin awoke 
to their pleas, and could do nothing but laugh, for it looked
as if she may still get back her pendant.

{x
{GTO STEW STEAKS OF MUTTON
{x
2 large steaks of mutton, tender preferably
1 pint dark beer or ale
2 onions, thinly sliced
a bit of salt
some pepper to taste
a handful of lard
{x
Bone the steak, trimming off any skin or other unwanteds.
Cut into thin slices across the grain. Place in a heavy pan
with the beer and onions, cover and simmer for a good hour.
Add the salt, pepper and butter and continue simmering for
half an hour longer, or until tender. A helpful hint here is
to add a touch of malt vinegar or cider vinegar, whichever
you have allowed to turn in your cellar.
{x
Fresh steaks are to be bled properly and allowed to soak in
salt water to purge any unwanted venoms or parasites.  This
will not help a purposefully envenomed steak.
{x
{GTO ROAST OLIVES OF VEAL
{x
A large veal round steak
2 hard boiled egg yolks
3 minced scallions
a bit of thyme
a tad of rosemary
a bit of salt
two bits of butter
{x
For The Sauce:
half a pint of white wine vinegar
a bit of butter
5 long canes of sugar
a bit of rosemary
{x
Remove any bones or other unwanteds from the veal and cut
into 4 pieces. Using a wine bottle, flatten the pieces as
flat as possible. Mix the egg yolks, scallions, thyme and
salt to form a paste. Divide the paste in fourths, and
spead one fourth onto each piece of veal. Roll up each piece
and tie with a length of string or cloth.
{x
Melt the butter in a heavy skillet. Brown the veal birds
lightly on all sides. Lower the heat and continue cooking
for a quarter of an hour. To make the sauce, combine all of
the sauce components in a small saucepan and bring to a boil;
reduce heat, and simmer. Pour the sauce over the veal birds
and cook lightly.

 to their beauty, as well as making them
 a highly prized trophy to be taken.

was there that he came to terms with the search for the Archives,
through the meeting of the most peculiar of friends.  Journey to this
inn, and there talk with a boy who knows of the faction.{x

The creators came again to oversee their work that was left to
chance with the flow of time.  What they found was disheartening,
for those who would seek the treasure of Blackstaff would do so
with little regard for what else could be understood.  With that,
they approached Laeral Silverhand with their concern:
{C
"We have surveyed the tower and it would appear that our original
securities have been compromised.  We now petition to the Lady
and Lord of Blackstaff a plan for revitalization of their most
humble tower."
{8
Laeral looked at Toby with a radiant smile.
{M
"The ability to read my mind is a mortal plight not to be taken
lightly.  I grant you and Mr. Sagacus free reign of our tower
for the duration of your stay here in Waterdeep.  Our only wish
is that what had existed before remain so again, and the only
intrusions you make are towards keeping ours to a minimal."
{8
The half-orc bowed with a grin, exposing his two fangs that he
tried so hard before to hide.  Clausius, who stood to the side
gave a bow as the will of Laeral saw both mortals swept away to
the base of the tower, where they began their work once again.

This is the account of the epic battle of god and mortal.
{8
In the Times of Troubles, the world laid precariously on
the scales of fate. The one who would possess the Tablets
of Fate in union could tip the scales in their favor. 
{8
Myrkul, the Lord of Bones, acquired the first Tablet of
Fate from Kelemvor and with it marched upon the City of
Splendors with an unholy army of demons.  The second
Tablet of Fate was there in this very tower where it was
locked in Blackstaff's secret vault by Elminster.  
{8
In several turns of circumstance, Myrkul acquired the
Tablet and attempted his escape, but the union of
heroes and gods engaged him on the tower's roof, where
he was vanquished by Midnight.  And in a bitter irony
at the eve of their victory, the mortal Cyric emerged
and plucked the Tablets from the ground where they lay.
{8
Their later ascention to godhood earned Midnight the
portfolio and name of Mystra and Cyric the god of murder,
strife and lies was born.  It was here that the tablets
were destroyed by the hand of Ao himself, but not before
revealing their uselessness.
{8
Of the tale not told was that of Myrkul, whose blood was
shed on the black granite of Blackstaff Tower.  There it
marred the mirrored surface forever and would later fall
within this very room.  Those versed in this tale, speak
the words now and to you shall be granted the blood of
Myrkul.{x

Another equally diabolical contraption is also simple in design.  An
iron cylinder placed upon the victim's bare chest with appropriate
straps and fastens.  The top is opened sufficiently to drop in one's
favorite rodents, and then capped with a basin of burning ash and oil.
The fun comes when the basin heats up the barrel sufficiently as to
drive the rodents into a frenzy and they attempt to claw and gnaw
their way downward away from the burning basin.  For added fun, the
burning oils can be allowed to spill over onto the victim, just
enough to keep the enjoyment going well into the late hours of the
night.

of this area with a small ledge of stone on either

Being in this place is extremely disconcerting. A
few waves pass over the surface of the sewage and
gives second thoughts that you are here alone. In
the black, murky water, there could be any number
of creatures and most likely they aren't harmless.{x

The green and brown sewage glistens with light as
you pass by. You grip your weapon and your packs
for fear of losing them in the pool of filth, and
if such a thing did happen, it would be next to a
winter day in nine hells when you find them again.{x

There is no solace here, only the infestation of
filth and the darkness which shrouds it. The pit
is concentric with the curtain wall and links up
with the tower by means of several dozen channel
arms which spiral out from a few center conduits.{x

The river of sewage is a good six feet in depth at
its center and shallows out on either end.  Within
swim creatures of such horror, only the gods would
know their nature. The air which is also saturated
with the stench teems with similar filth creatures.{x

The noxious smell is unbearable, but the prospect
of leaving this place fast is appealing.  Forward
there seems to be light, though it's difficult to
tell whether or not it's coming from some outside
hole or from your light reflecting from the walls.{x

Mind over matter.  That is what your mind tells
you but the matter in your stomach seems to beg

Further down the river of refuse you go, and at

it leads to the den of trolls or orcs you don't
care, as long as you find some fresh air that's

think twice about what may live within these ill

foot of debris and sewage.  This place is teeming

This corridor spurs off from the central spindle of
intervention: the conduit for immortals to traverse
various points throughout the realms.  The corridor
is a narrow tunnel, dark and foreboding, but simple
in design. The walls are common flatstone pieced by
painstakingly precise cuts without mortar. A simple
rectangular door sits at the other end equally dark
and foreboding, accented with interwoven bands made
of black iron and riveted to the base. A fine layer
of dark red rust sits on the iron, untouched by nay
a mortal hand for perhaps centuries.  Atop the door
is a long, square keystone, upon which is engraved:

This short corridor is dimly lit with many small openings
along the walls and ceiling from which tiny rays of light
permeate like spokes of a cart wheel. The air is thick in
fragrant scents and moisture, almost tropical in feel yet
not in look. The faint sounds of screaming animals can be
heard off in the distance.  About halfway in the corridor
there is a hugh paned mirror from which flashes images of
another place in the realms. Directly below the mirror is
a sign reading:  Immortal Viewing Glass - Blackstaff Roof.{x

The stairway from the foyer leads down to a large basement
where Dugmaren and his alter egos conduct highly secretive
research necessary to improve the balance of various areas
which fall under his supervision.  Several rooms spur away
from this one, in the four cardinal directions each casted
with an enchantment for viewing the dynamics of the heroes
and the runs they undergo.  The clandestine nature of this
research does not allow mortals here nor does it allow the
luxury of speaking about it, for here lies the secret to a
long earned success at creating and maintaining hero runs.{x

A narrow hallway extends this basement floor eastward,
where more rooms spur off each representing a viewing
room for the immortals to conduct research on mortals.
There is little else to hint at what this research is
about. The walls are barren, the floors clean, and in
the air is not a hint of smells.  In fact, this place
is devoid of sense and in that much it makes no sense,
for here sits just a fingertip out of touch with what
one would call normal.  Small beams of light dance in
all of the directions, save to the west were you came.{x

To the east you see a clouded and foreboding horizon behind Durlag's Tower
which may indicate the true nature of the tower better then the clean
looking stone tower which is more fotress than anything else. It is
surrounded by high walls and a ravine beyond that. You think to yourself
that anyone foolish enough to assault this compound would most certainly
be repelled.

is beginning to sink in.  Interestingly, at this height, you can
notice imperfections in the tower that were completely invisible from
the ground.  What looked like a perfectly round, smooth black column
is actually a rough, imperfect tower like any other.

black tower, you can't help but notice that despite it's enormous
size, the tower casts no shadow.  The distance between torches is
increasing as you climb, not helpful as the stairway seems to be in
the worse shape near the top.

Carved from ancient grey stone, the statues

Nothing can compare to the intricate stonework of
the reptile statues in this room.  The immaculate
attention to detail is utterly mind boggling.  Of
all the intricate features of the statues perhaps
the most impressive are the glowing emerald eyes.

You are in a cramped, narrow hallway. The statues
have been arranged in a single file line, staring
blankly towards the end of the hallway. A pulsing
green glow radiates from the back of the chamber,
but from here you cannot identify its source. Two
torches spark on opposite walls of this corridor,
yet somehow they produce no soot, smoke or scent.{X

small window. The City of Splendors rises to the southeast
like a great nation truly blessed by the gods. The strange
part about looking through this window is that despite the
large curtain walls which surround this place, none seems
to be present...

Statues are lined up back to back in this
area of the tower.  Facing away from each
other, they maintain the same stoic stare
as the other statues. Yet something seems
different - it could be that perhaps they
are a little shorter, or maybe their eyes
glow a little less brightly.  Or possibly
this is just another trick of this Tower.{X

The endless statue filled void continues on
stretching further than one could ever hope
to travel - or does it? As one moves upward
through the tower, the line between what is
real and what is illusion becomes even more
blurred.  The choice to continue belongs to
you: will you brave this Tower and discover
its secrets -  or return to safe Waterdeep?{X

a songbird chirps, a gentle breeze blows,

Mirrors of all shapes and sizes converge at strange angles across
the floor, ceiling and walls.  It is difficult to to even tell up from
down in this room.  There is no source of light, yet somehow, even
mirrors hundreds of yards away are visible.  This room is strange
indeed, but perhaps the strangest thing of all is the fact the despite
the presence of all the mirrors, you still can't see your own
reflection.

larger than it seems from a distance.  It is an illusion not of

make that much of a difference as far as your perspective on its

The cursed maze of statues is behind you.  You
stand now in an endless void of darkness.  The
only thing left to do is move north to begin a
new floor of mazes.  If there's one thing this
tower isn't short of it's mind boggling mazes.
A light in the distance offers some comfort as
it indicates the end is not too far from here.{X

a banner of one of the major powers of the realms. As the

You step through the mushroom and find yourself in
a brand new world. The surroundings look like they
were painted from a fantasy tale.  Birds sing from
lush leafy trees, mushrooms spot the green rolling
hills, and somewhere nearby you can hear the faint
trickle of a stream. The sky shines a radiant blue 
overhead while the sun beams brightly down on your
face.

floors, even the ceilings are unnaturally green

considering how easy it would be to undo.  What's more

The purpose of this place is still largely uknown.
Certainly, no one mentioned that Blackstaff Tower
had an intricate series of caverns beneath it and
it is a good guess that few people know it's here.{x

Onward the passages go. The monotony of the orange
walls can drive one insane. Claustrophobia is also
a concern in such a spot but such an affliction in
an adventurer's line of work would be detrimental.{x

The floor inclines slightly here, and the ceiling
dips down.  It would appear that you are reaching
some sort of end to this cavern system, though it
is not for certain what will be in waiting there.{x

Here, the way splits apart into three directions, but
it cannot be discerned which one leads to a promising
end. The southern passage appears to incline slightly
which may suggest that it will lead to higher ground.{x
