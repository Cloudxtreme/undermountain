~
He's a skinny fellow, in his mid 200's with a terrible habit of
picking his nose.  He's working intently on carving something in the
wood of his booth, which is scarred from years of this sort of thing. 
He must have a boring job indeed, but perhaps your business will liven
up his day.

bright purple suit with funky ripples and a top hat to match.  Hints
of body tattoos show past his sleeves and on the back of his neck,
perhaps a tribal rite of passage.  In any case, he looks pretty mean,
so no funny business at his establishment.

A man, obviously stoned off his ass, is here, resting against the counter and smoking from his pipe.

{MD{mrakolan is your average stoner man, except that he looks too old
for the scene.  Appearing to be in his late 50s, his long greying hair
hangs down to his upper back, well, what's left of it that is.  He
also has a rather large, superbly shiny bald spot, which reflects the
light of the room in almost a blinding affect.  He is leaning up
against the counter, smoking on his pipe, and staring at nothing.  Not
even sure if he notices you yet...  {x

+-------------[ Heifong III ]-------------+
  The Heifong City Region, 5 small cities
which grew together with the explosion of
airships by business and profits.  The 5
cities were then turned into one giant
government, known as Heifong.  Heifong III
is ruled by Xavier Vector, undead and once
ruler of the Vectorian Empire hundreds of
years ago.  Heifong is also known to be
home to the Black Market.

{c
These words were meant for either of my two sons who bear the family
name, Sagacus.  If you are not them, then I implore you to deliver
this letter and the crest in which is wrapped to them.  A generous
reward is ensured if you do, and our eternal gratitude for helping
to save them.  
{c
To my sons listen well for this may be the last you will hear of me.
Last week I was in a poker game with some rather shady individuals
who left the table with only the shirts on their back.  Two days ago,
my airship was impounded for no apparent reason and with it many of
my worldly possessions, including my logbook and journal.  No doubt
they have read about you and about the Sagacus Hoard and I fear that
my family is no longer safe.
{c
I have spent a lifetime protecting my family by keeping as far away
from them as I can, but to this end I have failed. I have failed you,
and I am sorry.
{c
Know why I left you:  I and the Sagacus line are cursed in blood to
forever succum to the will of others.  A millenia ago, we were given
the gift of insight towards magical arts and foresight.  In this
deal with the gods, our ancestors saved the line from ending, but
paid a great price, for forever would the Sagacus name be cursed to
live in servitude.  I cannot save you, my sons, from that curse, but
I can keep you in my sights for as long as I am alive.  However, my
life may not be guaranteed much longer, and so with this crest I ask
you to seek guidance.  A mage once divulged that there was perhaps a
cure, for one gifted with the insight to find it.  My search has
failed, but yours may succeed.  For us and for the line of Sagacus,
I bid you luck and love.

better with the neighborhood.  All sorts of interesting drug

tripped out old man is leaning against the counter, staring at a stain
in the roof.  Perhaps the answers to the world are in that stain, or
perhaps he has sampled too much of his own product.  {x

This warehouse seems to be a sort of hub for the bums of the city. 
Many bums are standing and chatting here, there is a lot of traffic
moving in and out.  This is the center of the bum community.  It is
the most 'clean' of the warehouses, although still filled with dirt
and garbage.

excellent place to relax after a long journey by airship.  Weary
travelers sip drinks or talk quietly as the prepare to head out to the

don't show it as the hurry to and from the port.

This is the intersection of Valiant Street and Xavier Avenue.  The
trickle of a fountain can be heard from the north.  Xavier Avenue
doesn't seem too dirty as it leads to the north section of town, which
is much cleaner then the rest.

IV.  This gate leads into the next part of the city, ruled under a
different ruler than as that of Heifong III.  The drive around is

  A large tower stands here, 50 stories tall stretching up towards
the sky.  All around the large metal tower is green fields.  In the
far distance to in almost all directions, hidden behind some haze, are
mountains that stretch towards to the sky, into the clouds.  A large
concreate area opens up here, and then into a road leading west.  To
the west a very large road can be seen heading towards a massive city.
Up and down the massive road to the west, airships fly.  A large ARROW
points to the west.

The Wreckball Arena~
~
You have entered a Wreckball arena, where the most popular and bloody sport
even known to anyone is played. Wreckball has but one rule- get your ball
past the opponent's goal line. Absolutely any means are allowed to be used
to achieve this. To prove this point, you are suddenly forced to duck as a
head comes sailing past you from the playing pit to the south. Audience
members, disappointed as missing out on the juicy spectacle, angrily demand
that you sit down or get out.

The Pit~
~
Wreckball is played in a plasteel pit lined with razor blades about half the
size of your regular football field and about ten meters deep. Players are
lowered in via hoversleds by the armored RefBots, and then play commences
thirty seconds after the indestructible titanium ball is dropped in. The
match lasts exactly one hour- no time-outs, no intervals, no breaks, no
half-time entertainment. Just one hour of pure, unbridled bloodshed and
carnage. You force yourself to stop drooling and enjoy the game.

{GA{gmidst the hustle and bustle, the city administrators have taken
the time to build a small park in the center of the city.  Although
they would rather see the land used for a more profitable purpose,
popular vote and pressure by civic leaders successfully managed to

This is obviously not the best part of town to live in, and these
are obviously not the best apartments to call home.  They are the
cliche of run-down apartments, even the road sign has burnt out bulbs!
But none the less, this apartment is the home of Mikal Doniv, one of
the many airship mechanics in this part of town.  It is a small little
apartment, just a bedroom, the bathroom, and the living room, which
doubles as a kitchen.  Not the greatest piece of property, but it's

best burger in Heifong.  Times have changed for
this tiny restaurant, and while they will still
serve a burger and fries, it looks like most of
the {@p{2rofit{@s{X come from the pale ale flowing from
wooden kegs behind the bar.  The bar runs along
the entire wall, and a few booths and tables have
been placed in the corner for those who would
like to sit down and eat.  {!F{1at {!S{1mitty{X himself is
working behind the bar, smoking a {3cigarette{X and
flipping burgers.

Pots and pans litter the floor next to spilled boxes
of food and old newspapers.  Picture frames hang broken
on the walls, and old clothes collect dirt and dust on
the floor.  Whoever lived here last sure left in a rush,
and no one has made any effort to clean it up or move
back in.

This room is unoccupied.  Surprisingly, however, this
room is in better shape than those with people living
in them.  The {Btile{X floor is chipped in places, and the
wall {#p{3ape{#r{X is peeling in strips along the back wall,
but overall, this room is in good shape.  Facing north,
one can look out a {3dirt{X smudged window at the clubs and
shops of the street below.

Cracked {*plaster{X is peeling off the walls in strips
in this cramped apartment.  The room is very sparsely
furnished, a collapsed couch {@m{2ildew{@s{X in one corner
while a few clumbsy looking chairs are arranged in
a circle around a large bong.  A filthy matress lies
bare in the corner opposite the couch, surrounded by
empty liquor bottles.  It appears as if no one is
home at the moment, and that the apartment is used
only as a place to crash after long nights of club
hopping and partying on the streets below.

Three thin steel bunk beds fill this cramped room.
Graffiti covers the walls, ceiling, floor, virtually
every blank space in the room has been covered by

love notes.  Suitcases on the far bed indicate that
this is some kind of free youth hotel, although there
is no evidence of a management or someone in charge.

the street.  A well-crafted door has been attached to the entrance,
and a quality lock has also been installed.  The walls and carpets are
clean, and the air smells fresh.  A couple of nice pieces of furniture
