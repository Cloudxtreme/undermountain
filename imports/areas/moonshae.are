{BThis man looks to be young, but his brown eyes tell a different
tale - of someone much older and much wiser.  His blue robes are
dark and have a few runes embroidered on the cuffs - a mark of 
one that may know some things, but not all.  He holds an orb in
his hand and peers deeply into it.{x

If the  mirrored  portals are  ever again  discovered on the
Material Plane, it is advised by this traveler to smash them 
into shards. It is far better to have the Nerra left to seek 
out the Material  Plane through a long search than a readily 
accessible door.
{x
I have  since had to deal with the  frustration in knowing I
aided in the bringing  about many hardships for those of the
Material Plane.  With time, perhaps I can forgive myself and 
still be  of service  to others.  Perhaps, with  time, I can 
find the portals and end my link to the Nerra for good.

I wandered  the Nerra's  home plane for many  months  before
finally  discovering a method for seeing beyond the reflect-
ive surfaces  to reveal  the many  entrances from  beyond to
the plane they called home. I left using the first available
portal, and  none too  soon, as they had  sent a not-so-kind
Varoot assassin to follow me as I overstayed my welcome.
{x
I am sad  to say that when  I went in search of the mirrored
portals I was  unable to find any of them, nor was I ever a-
gain able to reach  the demi-plane of  my own creation - for
the Nerra  had erased my presence from it forever - possibly
covered over in the mirror ether.
{x
I recommend  to any who encounter a Nerra to be wary and, if 
possible, stay clear.  I cannot say what they will do, if in 
fact they will  act, but for  all their  beauty, they can be 
quite devious in their designs.

It troubled me, however, that the citizens of the city there-
in were  merely reflections of reflections - endless repeti-
tions in their faces. It is not possible to see them for what 
they are  within - as though their skin acts to protect them 
from revealing their deeper natures.
{x
I was  taken to a castle whereupon I was  treated to a visit
with a superior. Though Zar'ach had been kind in befriending
me, I fast  discovered - to my dismay - that the purpose for 
my demi-plane was  an easy access for them to infiltrate the 
Material Plane for experimental  reasons.  When I questioned 
further, I was reminded of my status as a guest.
{x
Still, I could not help but vouch for the innocents they pro-
posed to remove.  I was  very unceremoniously deposited out-
side of the castle and told that I would have to find my own 
way.  My friendship with Zar'ach was, unfortunately, termin-
ated by force.

I could not  pass up such  an offer and I set about using my
talents to create  for them a "way station."  After its com-
pletion, a full year  having passed, Zar'ach and I set about 
making portals  to the  travel  between  the three locations 
easily.  The material was incredible.
{x
Mirror-like  ether was  brought  to me, appearing like a set
liquid, behaving  like a pliable metal, setting up as a pane 
of reflective glass. After embuing two sets of these portals 
with the  magic to travel the planes, two were set up within 
the  material  plane, one on  the demi-plane, and one in the 
Mirrored Planar home of the Nerra.
{x
We set forth to test them, and from the demi-world of my cre-
ation, I stepped into the mirrored portal to arrive in a world 
that was created  solely of the substance Zar'ach had deliv-
ered to me.  Within the reflections, I saw myself as my true 
self, which was a relief to discover I was as decent as I felt 
my heart to be.

{x
What most struck me was the mirror finish of Zar'ach's skin.
Given  the folding of the mirror  skin over a humanoid body,
the reflections  gave the impression  of metal at first, but
only on  close inspection was it  given  over the  fact that
this man who  moved about with  impeccable grace was made of
glass.
{x
Within the Celestial realm, my homeland, we are known for be-
ing on the side of good, which was to my benefit.  Disregard-
ing my  disguise, Zar'ach  saw through me easily, and indeed, 
when seeing  myself in the reflection of his glassy skin - I 
was revealed as a great gold glow. A most pleasing discovery.
{x
I informed him I had interest in his plane, being a traveler
of the  planes and a creator  of them, to  which  he offered
an exchange of sorts.  He would take me to his home world if 
I would build  them a separate demi-plane capable of linking 
them exclusively to the Material Plane.

In my many years of planar travels and developments of demi-
planes, I  had  yet to  encounter  a people  quite  like the
Nerra of the  Mirror Plane.  It was with considerable effort
that I was permitted into their realm, and with equal effort
was I able to find  a way out.  For  those seeking out these
peoples, be prepared for much subterfuge and a long search.
{x
Reaching this  plane is best accomplished with the good will 
of a  Nerra, particularly of the  Sillit class - for without 
the good  graces of their  leadership, one  might find them-
selves swiftly at the wrong end of a Kalareem's blade.
{x
It is most  unfortunate  that I cannot  share how to contact
these peoples, for it was merely  by happenstance I encount-
ered  one in the  City of Sigil on  one of my many trips.  I
was fortunate  to run into  Zar'ach Ra'nakah and make a very
favorable impression

{y|  {wpotion - the nectarine is the primary choice.  It is a    {y|
{y|  {wclose relative of the peach, giving it the ability to     {y|
{y|  {wflow forth with abundant juice, but the nakedness of its  {y|
