Makou energy can be harnessed with the use of magical rods.  These
rods, enchanted with varies spells, will attract mako energy.  These
rods are placed in the reactor core of a Class A Makou Reactor.  The
rods attract the energy, gather it and sends it to the compression
chamber, through iron rods, wrapped into each other.  Steam from the
steam engines in the reactor compress the energy in the chamber which
is thrown between two iron rods, will cause a chemical reaction and
creature diffrent forms of mako.  Diffrent pressures will give
diffrent results, but depends on the reactor type.  Class A reactors
produce Makou Gas, which after compressed in the chambers, is pumped
out to storage tanks, and into your homes.  Most reactors are started
by coal for the steam engine, but after makou gas is produced, it
creates the fire for the steam engine.

The world has an energy flowing deep within the planet.  This
stream or energy is known as the lifestream, which gives life to all
living things.  All living things has Mako Energy in them, when you
die, this energy is returned to the lifestream.  In some areas, Mako
Energy can even be seen in a solid form, known as Materia.  Materia is
found usually around mountains, where mako energy is strong.  As Mako
Fountains are, those fountains being the focal point of the Mako
Energy.  WARNING: High exposure to the lifestream or raw Mako Energy
in large amounts can poison any living being.  There is no cure.

The Reception Hall Of The Tower~
~
You are finally before the huge glass elevator you saw on your way up the
stairs.  A couple couches and other pieces of furniture are lined up against
the white-painted walls, put there for you to sit on while you wait for the
elevator.  A large ding is heard as the elevator comes down to the floor you
are on.  Its now safe to go in.  Exits are south, and north into the
elevator.  A sign hangs on the floor.  If you want to see the president i
would read it.  (LOOK SIGN).

|       THE TRIPOWER TOWER COMPLEX         |
+------------------------------------------+
| The tower uses alot of Mob Programs,     |
| which makes your visit just a little     |
| more interesting than most areas. Floors |
| 1-10 are public, and no one can get      |
| passed the 10th floor without a security |
| pass. If you want to see the President,  |
| Just say 19th in the room with Beth. She |
| will transfer you to Nicki, where you    |
| will read a sign that explains Nicki's   |
| Mob Programs. Also you can see see the   |
| President by talking to Sidney on the    |
| 5th Floor East Wing.                     |

Welcome to the City of Torregiano, city of technology, home of the
Tripower Empire, capital of the trade market, and many other things. 
A large lounge stands before you, white walls with paintings, and
small gas lights giving light.  Several couches and chairs line the
room, and a large table sits in the middle of the room covered with
books and other items for reading.  A door to the east leads out to
the lobby of the Tripower Tower Complex, headquarters of the Tripower
Nation.  To the south of the lobby is the great city of Torregiano.

{x  Most kingdoms are ruled by a council of people made up of the King or
Queens loyalest subjects, but this not how the Tripower Kingdom is ran.
The Tripowerian Congress is made up of members known as Senators, who
help the Kingdom rule over itself.  New laws and matters are voted on,
and worldly matters are spoken of.  As the largest government in the
Great Realms, the Tripower Kingdom plays a major role to all other bodies
of government.  Within these chambers that government is controlled.

Lobby of the {!D{1epart. {!O{1f {!J{1ustice{x. ~
~
Here lies the reception lobby of the Department of Justice.  A
circular room ringed pentagonally by eight grand marble pillars and
connected by halls of ivory and alabaster to all points of the
compass.  A beautiful bronze casting of the sun ornately caps the
ceiling and a large red and black-barred TriPower flag drapes from the
center.  The secretary at the desk appears to busy to take note of
visitors or anyone who roams the halls.

The Western Hall~

These halls shine brightly from the sun entering from the windows
at the end of the northerly hallway.  The alabaster halls are coursed
with thin veins of silver and make for a dazzling array of contrasting
shine.  Potraits of several Grand Judges line the walls in a tribute
to their magnificent service to the common folk and to the values of
law and order.  Down the hall to the west sits a sign reading (Quiet! 
Meeting in Progress).  At the end of the north hall is a
glass-enclosed promenade.

Obviously this hallway is a bit of a toned down expanse of luxury. 
It proceeds north to a large room and all of the walls are plastered
with grayish clay and tannish wallpaper.  A few portraits rest on the
walls but they are perfectly meaningless individuals.  Nothing special
seems to take part of this side of the directorate.

moments in celestial hierarchy and law and the creation of immortal
order line both sides of the halls.  The obsidian statuettes that line
the halls represent the individual legendary law-givers of the Order
of Justice's ancestors, the Imperial Guards.  The door at the end of
this hall lies slightly open.

a large central mailing system that shoots mail and information tubes
pneumatically to the hundreds of offices and distribution centers.  A
large dumwaiter is used to bring up large crates from beneath the
tower.  Nothing really interesting...

You step out of the elevator onto the shiny floor of the TriPower
building.  A large sign on the wall, which is painted a bright sort of
green, catchs your eye.  It declares this floor the place where all the
TriPowers money is handled and sometimes spent.  A security guard checks to
see if your a citizen and are authorized , then waves you through.  South,

Leadership of the Dragon's Hoard.  A huge cedar desk stands at the
southernmost part of the room.  On it are stacks and stacks of papers, that
he has to review and sign.  The skylights of the room allow you to see the
sun in the day, and the stars at night.  A jacuzzi is installed on the
eastern part of the room, there for Jaal's amusement.  A huge picture of a
grassy meadow is hung across the whole western wall.  The only exit is

plaques for good work.  AS you look in through the small glass windows above
each office door you can see peons of the tripower working futilely at
stacks of paper.  Exits lead south north, west and east.

command.  A plaque stating the name of the worker is the only thing hanging
on the drab brown painted walls, and a large mahogany desk is the only piece
of furniture.  On the desk is a large pile of paper work, which would look
very daunting if you had to do it.  The only exit is south.

around you on errands, and one even crashes full force into you.  North,

measly little office worker.  The only exit is south.

Security Check~
~
The lights of machinery glare down at you as you walk into this part of
the hall.  There is a metal detector in the middle of it, with a security
guard standing next to it.  You are ushered into the metal detector by the
guard, and forced to remove your weapons.  The walls here are no longer
green, but are more metallic.  You can see a large door to your west.  There
is also an exit to your east.

The Door to the Vault~
~
You are standing before a huge metal door.  A security guard stands
before the door, guarding it with his life, or at least to some extent.  The
door has a small metal device on the edge of it, which is used to swipe a
security card through it.  Only then would the door open and let you inside
the vault filled with money.

The TriPower Vault~
~
You are standing inside the TriPower Vault!  Large metallic shelves hold
piles upon piles of TriPower issue money, and even some gold and platinum
printed with the TriPower seal.  There is a security camera mounted atop one
of the shelves, so you better not get greedy and try to steal from here. 
Only way back out is through the large vault door to your east.

A Well Polished Hallway~
~
The yellow walls, and the shiny, polished floor all send a pain through
your eyes as the light hits them.  Two oak doors stand north and south of
you, leading off into large and luxurious offices of the TriPower
executives.  There are afew memos and notices on the walls, but they don't
seem very interesting.  Office workers hustle and bustle around here as well
as some janitors.

A More Spacious Office~
~
You have walked into a luxurious office of a TriPower executive.  You can
see the whole city through the huge window on the wall to the south.  A
large mahogany desk stands in the middle of the room, with a few papers
stacked neatly upon it.  The walls are metallic in nature and have a few
paintings of landscapes hanging upon them.  The only exit is north.

A More Spacious Office~
~
You have entered an incredibly spacious and luxurious TriPower office. 
The skylights look out over the city, and there is a large bath tub in the
center of the room.  A huge mahogany desk is in the corner of the room,
neatly stacked with newly printed money and such.  The executive is on the
phone with the distributors of the money, who are waiting for a new batch. 
The only exit is south.

The Mint~
~
You have walked into the part of the tower where the TriPower money is
actually made.  Large machines make a huge whirring noise as you enter, and
the people using huge molds to shape the gold look directly up at you.  You
can barely see the walls, are this room is so large, and filled with molds
and machines to melt gold.  Printing presses can be seen south, printing all
the paper money, and more gold melting is happening to your north.

The Printing Floors~
~
You are walking in the federal mint of the TriPower.  Large vats of gold
are poored into huge iron molds, filled with tiny idividual molds that shape
the gold into tiny gold coins.  People then collect the tiny coins after
they are cool, and put thme in large sacks, with the TriPower seal on them. 
The only exit is south.

You have walked onto the southern edge of the printing floors, where the
TriPower money is actually made.  Workers put large sheets of paper into
metal slots, from there, the paper is stands with the tripower seal.  After
that the paper is cut into many different slices, and those are each
stamped.  The little slices are collected by still more people.  The only
exit is north.

The Department of City Leaders~
~
You have entered the department of city leaders.  There is a large
bulletin board on the white painted wall ahead of you.  It seems to state
the names of the city leaders of the TriPower citys.  A few politicians and
secretarys walk past you now and again, but mostly this hall is pretty
quiet.  East and west you can see a huge hall which leads to the different
City Leader's offices.

A Long Hallway~
~
You are walking down a long hallway within the department of City's
leaders floor.  Secretarys and politicians walk along this hall with you,
going to the mayor's offices.  The makou lights glare down at you from up on
the ceiling, and create an eerie atmosphere mixed with the shiny white
floor.  You can hear voices in all the offices, which probably means there
are meetings going on.

~
On top of the world is what some people might call this place.  Not
many structures in the Great Realms stretch this high into the skies. 
One of the few starting accomplishments of the Tripower Kingdom. 
Below stands forth the city of Torregiano, from the grassy plains in
the south stretching to the mountains, or the great sea-port and Istar
Sea to the north.  Even the great Makou Cannon is below this roof
line, only by several feet though.  Far off to the north on a dark
night, the lights of St.  Plattsburg can be seen on the horizon, and
beyond it Vector City.  To the southwest of the city, almost like a
green beacon the flaming sign of Makou City appears within the
mountains.  Beyond it the Elven Valley and city of Westbridge.

and grassy plains lies the Southern Mountains.

case.  This room will be used to study the plant discovered earlier,
what was it called....cannabis?

This room is off limits to unauthorized personnel.  Through out the

some give off ultrasound, and some even have a degree of intelligence. 
Its best not to mess with stuff in this room, unless you really want to

herbs and plates where stored here.  However, most of the employees have
cleaned it out by now.  All that remains is a brick of some funny
smelling weed that no one  wants for some reason.

File Room~

Filing cabinets line this small room.  And on top of the cabinets are
more files, and more on the floor.  Even some are tacked to the walls. 
Every thing the Department has researched, written or copied is
somewhere in here.  Good luck finding anything.

Entrance hallway.~

A sign hangs from the ceiling that says "Now
entering the Import/Export Area. This corner of
beauracracy ruled and designed by Arkady. All hail the
Tri-Power!!" Somehow, you are not amused by this. You
can go south, back the way you came, or press on to
the north.

Customs Office~
~
This is where all the imported and exported
goods are inspected to make sure no illegal goods are
passing through the Tri-Power area. You see an
inspector looking at all of the stuff. Several men
carry in a large crate, and the inspector scans it
with a magic wand. He nods his head, and the men carry
the crate out of the room. You have an odd feeling
that if you hold very still, he'll inspect you too.
The exits are east and west to warehouse-type rooms,
north to an office, or south to the entrance.

overwhelmed by the smell of garlic. You see a large
pile of sharp wooden stakes in the corner. You
accidentaly bang your head on a lantern hanging from
the ceiling. It has a logo that says "Mako Gas-Light
Co." On a desk there is a black bag filled with
surgical instruments. Shelves are lined with severed
body parts pickled in some strange chemical. On an
operating table, there is a dead body. It has two
round bite marks on its neck, and has a stake through
its chest.

Uh Oh. It looks as though the Tri-Power
hirelings messed up big time. A large crate that might
have been filled with magical potions has tipped over.
The side that says "This side up" is upside down. The
crate is surrounded by shattered glass and bubbling
blue liquid. An executive is screaming expletives at
harried workers.

noisily chatter during their breaks.  There are large tables neatly orientated to give
for maximum capacity.  The entire cafateria is lit by several lamps that give off a
pale green light.

to see what happened and you notice... uh-oh the janitor's gonna be pissed now
someone dropped their tray... As everyone else in the room comes to the same

to yourself, "That man must've eaten to much of his own cooking..."

only big enough for one or two people.  As you approach the corner you see a stack of
trays for you to put your food on.

Which explanes why the floor and walls are padded.  The people that work here don't
want any of the explosives to detonate if they fall and hit a hard surface, which
some just might.

Center of the Council Meeting Hall~
~
You are standing in the very center of the Council Room.  As you look
around you see that the entire room is almost shaped like a bowl, with
this being the lowest part.  The carpeting here is blood red with grey
patterns.  In the center of the room there is a huge table, with enough
seats for all the heads of each department.  At the head of the table
sits a large and ornate chair, which is reserved for the President or
his assign representative.

Northern Section of the Audience~
~
You are standing in the northern section reserved for members of 
the press. You see that the seats here are barely cushioned and
you also notice that the accoustics here are extremely good as
nobody wants the lacky reporters to twist everything thats said.
The floor here is tiled instead of carpeted to make it easier
to clean.

You see that the benches here are angled off the other set to
make the line have a more u-shape to it, and that they are
richly decorated.  As you get ready to take a seat you notice 
that the meeting has started and that everyone has become very
quiet to listen in on the meeting.

council room.  The benches here have the same lavish decor as
the rest of the hall.  The floor, much like the otherside, is
tiled to make it easy to clean.  As you look ahead you see that
all the benches are connected together to form a horseshoe 
around the center of the room, where the department heads and
the president, or his representative, meet to cover the 
necessary happenings in the realms.

as you look closer you swear that it is looking back at you.  You see
many paintings of the marvelous inventions that the Department of
Science has created and even a model of an Airship is hanging from
the ceiling.

{x  You stand in the blackhole of the TriPower.  The place, where all power
comes from.  You stand in a large office, expanding most of the length of
the tower.  Large windows surround the whole room, you see a balcony
outside, the circles the whole tower.  Between each window, a gas light
burns, with its green flame.  The office is dressed in the TriPower Fasion. 
Towards the back, a large desk stands, with papers and other important
documents placed on it.  The ceiling extends very high, almost like a
cathedral.  Outside the windows, gives view to the city of Torregiano. 
Miles of buildings and roads extend either way, all around the office.  To
one side, you see "Stalin's Organ" sticking out from the tower, and across
the city.  In the distance, in each corner of the great wall, you see a
large building, with a green glow flowing from it.  To the north, you see
the Sea Of Istar, and the Port of Torregiano.  To the north, you see the
Highland Mountains.  On the floor, the TriPower Bars spread across the whole
office, and flags hang down around the room, with the TriPower Bars on them.
A door to the west leads out to the balcony, and outside the door, you see a
large platform extending away from the tower.  An airship, tied to the
tower, floats just above the platform.  Welcome To The President's Office.
