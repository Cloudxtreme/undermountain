nemu conclave guard~
{%N{^e{6mu{^r{%a{x~
With purple skin and translucent wings, {%N{^e{6mu{^r{%a{x stands here.
~
With a strange but mezmerizing grace, this lady moves about,
tending to the construction of the formless boundraies of the Citadel.
She seems to be draconian, due to her iridescant wings of dragonkind
nature, but her skin has a smooth, delicate appearance.  Her eyes are
strange.  The iris of each eye is colored in ever changing {-c{-o{-l{-o{-r{-s{x.  A
very beautiful woman indeed, but you get the strangest sensation that
it wouldn't be a good idea to...  'try' anything.

overproportioned, however subtracts nothing from her charm.

{!The Transcedent Path{x~
~
Walking along a crystal-clear bridge of hewn Quartz, the world
seems to spiral into infinty bounds beyond.  Reality's very fabric
seems to crumble into unspeakable parts and counterparts, shifting
into a virtuoso space, saturating your senses with sounds and
sensations not meant for the mortal creations.  Beyond, there is a
glimpse, a simple realm of Perfection, Unity, and Oneness.  
 
That vision is the place known as '{@The Garden{x'.  The true Center of all creation.

The Walks circumnavigate the actual center gardens, flourshing
below.  The gardens are a lush, near-tropical barbican of dense
forest.  The walkway is a thin translucent substance, which is not
quite metal, not quite mineral, which circles to a point beyond: 
 
A large city which seems to be a perfect balance of Technology and Nature.
The City the Conclave have sought after for ages.
The Homeworld.
