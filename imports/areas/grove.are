Blue room~
~
You are in the blue room, one of the guest rooms in Dragon's mansion. The
walls are (surprise!) blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar
shades, producing a very nice, cool effect. There is a large bed and a
matching set of sofas, easy-chairs and a coffee table. Through the venetian
blinds in front of the large east window you can see the edge of the grove.

Hallway~

You are standing in the south end of the hallway.  There are doors in the
elegant oak-panelled walls to the south, east and west.  Many different
coat-of-arms adorn the walls here.  In the wood above the western doors,
"TR" has been carved into it.

Red room~
~
You are in the red room, one of the guest rooms in Dragon's mansion. The
walls are wallpapered a deep warm red, and dark mahogany panelling nicely com-
plements them. There is a large, warm waterbed and a sofa group in dark wood
with leather upholstery, including a coffee table. Heavy brown curtains are
pulled away from the wide windows, to reveal a nice view towards the grove.

Kitchen~
~
You are standing in the middle of Dragon's kitchen. Contrary to popular
belief, He *doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large
variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

Ballroom~
~
You are standing in the middle of a vast palisander floor.  This is where
Dragon entertains large number of guests, but the cloth-covered chairs
standing forlornly in a corner suggests that this does not happen often. 
There are doors in the south and east walls, while to the west there is a
short corridor to the greenhouse.  In the middle of the ballroom, a table,
made from wooden planks and rocks sits, painted on the wood, a large circle
with the letters "TR" painted in the middle.

Greenhouse~
~
This is Dragons' greenhouse. Green light filters in slantwise through the
plants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,
though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except 
the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
terrace.

Dining hall~
~
This is Dragons' dining hall.  There is a large long solid oak table,
seating at least 24, with heavy, wooden chairs to match.  The oak panel
walls are filled with paintings.  There are doors to the north and east, and
to the west there is a wide double door opening out onto the sunlit terrace.
A large "TR" has been cut over the northern Doorway.

painting paintings~
There are many, many beautiful paintings of famous dragons of history and
literature. There is a big one of Smaug, a group picture of Cuspidorian Toxic
Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of Norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-
and-white photograph of Vorgulremik the Steel Dragon, a romantic picture of 
Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, 
while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) 
fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great 
beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest 
portrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.

Terrace~
~
You are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion.  To
the west, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake.  To
the north is the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and
wonderful colors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the
east.  It is warm and calm here.  There is a white-painted table with a
parasol here, together with a matched set of chairs.  Above the doors
leading into the Mansion, a large "TR" has been cut into the stone.

At the edge of the grove~
~
You are standing at the entrace of a beautiful grove of trees, and
your heart is filled with pure, peaceful thoughts.  This looks like a
safe place to recover from the wounds of adventuring.  A faint path
through the grove lies below you, and you can see the eastern road to
the south.

Ehlonna's Sanctuary~
~
Low shrubs and hedges part here to allow unobstructed view of a
small forest clearing.  Lush green grass grows tall, and wildflowers
of every species carpet the ground with an array of color.  A small
stream lazily wends its way through one side of the land, and cheerful
birdsong provides a polyphonic symphony to the ears.  Ancient trees
form a mottled green canopy overhead, and an altar stands in the
center of the clearing.  Forest creatures of all sizes come here to
find sanctuary from the tumultuous worlds, and a stately unicorn
grazes in solitude.

Inside the grove~
~
As you walk among the stately oaks of this grove, you feel at peace and 
in harmony with this beautiful forest.  If only the rest of the lands were
so tranquil.  The trail turns towards the east, leading into the secluded
trees of the druids' holy grove, and a path back to the eastern road lies
south.
