him an inposing figure.  He is elderly, wrinkles creasing his ruddy
skin, and a hint of white hair peeks out from under his white, rolled
wig.  One crooked hand clasps his gravel, and his eyes are hard and
cold, as though he has already decided the fate of the next person who
comes before him.

Maximum Security Jail Cell~

You find yourself immersed in near-total darkness..  The only light is
coming from three narrow slits in the heavy iron door.  The whole room has a
musty odor, as if it hasn't been cleaned in a long time.  The walls are
completely bare, constructed of solid stone blocks which offer no hope of
escape.  You even hear the slow drip-drip sound of water in the distance. 
All in all, it's the perfect dungeon cell.  Too bad you're in it.

behind it.  To one side sits a jury box, a door to its side.

As you enter this room you are struck blind at the radiance of it.  A
pure white throne of marble sits as a island in the middle of it issuing a
order of law and justice.  Servants and petitioners surround the throne
waiting for their master to come back and show them the way of law.  You
mouth a quick prayer to Tymora for letting you escape the law a little and
bow before the throne hoping that Tyr doesn't find out.
