He is between six to seven feet in height with massive shoulders
and long, dark hair.  He wears a ragged leather apron covered in
pockets and stained with charcoal and blood.  Along his bare arms and
chest are countless scars from searing sparks.  The hammer he wields
is gigantic.  It is simple in design, having a large wooden handle
wrapped in leather and reinforced with strips of iron that are bolted
and brazed to the blackened wedge of the head.  There is something
unnatural about it, as it glows faintly with the blue hue of
enchantment.

An {*eel-like {ywyrm{  flutters about, snapping at the air around it.
~
Looking like a huge flying snake, the dragon's weight is impossibly
supported by two tiny wings partway down its length, fluttering madly.
It's body, over a foot thick, is covered by greyish bronze scales
which continue right up to the dragons head.  Four huge fangs protrude
from its mouth, seemingly bigger than the head itself.  The head,
though small clearly distinguishes this beast as a dragon as its maw
opens incredibly wide to chomp the air beside it.

This beast appears as half snake, half humanoid.  From the waist

From the waist up she is a beautiful comely female besides the
horrible visage embedded on her face.  The other feature that gives
away her true tanar'ri nature is the 6 arms each swinging about its
own demonic weapon.

A {8Silk Spider{x dangles from a branch.
~
This spider is enormous--perhaps a foot across and equally long. 
Most of the size of this spider is in the form of a massive silk
pouch, for which these creatures are revered.  Silk hunters the world
over come to these ancient forests to hunt them, but rarely do they
make their way this deep into the wilderness.

despite there being little left of it.  They are bound to it by their
living blood pact, though it is unclear who summoned them here again
and from where they were summoned from.  Many speculate theirs is the
otherworld of the tetraplane--the domain of the Weave itself, while
others who take another view call this the river of the Gaian
lifestream.  In any event, they possess immense powers to fend of the
demons: their one and only task in our realms.

This medium sized wyrm is a mystery.  The first mystery being the
strange fact that it sits here in the open, rather than its preferred
abode of damp caverns and niches.  As wyrms tend to guard over
treasures, the second mystery is what exactly this wyrm is guarding. 
There is some indication that it is guarding this small passage, as it
is the only means by which one can access the eastern ward of the
ruins.  With long, jagged fangs and bony claws, you wonder if perhaps
this wyrm will be an easy adversary to challenge.

A {Wphantom {Bs{8o{Br{8ce{Br{8o{Br{x stands guard over the doorway.
~
This phantom bears the likeness of a robed sorceror grasping a ball
of pure magic that illuminates this room in a purple-blue haze.  Its
robes are torn and transparent, revealing a half-fleshed skeleton of
what you can only guess is a humanoid: tall and confident in its
posture.  The school had several such sorcerors in its ranks, for
defense and for instruction, as they were often highly skilled
wielders of offensive magics, rivaling the wizards of today, but
commanding words that are intonable in many racial tongues.  Their
magics spanned several subdisciplines of the Weave: benediction,
beguiling, transposition, creation, and even the necrotic arts,
excelling in the white magics of the undead.  A formidable foe that
you are hesitant to take on in any capacity, yet it does not approach
you aggressively, nor will it strike unless provoked.  If your
intentions are good, then you are safe here.

He sits kneeling, one knee upon a helm, and seemingly speaking to a
stone that lies upright here among many.  He has a whitening beard,
suggesting that he is aged beyond the showing years, as this place can
do for those who stay within the shroud of the Mythal.  A deep hood
hangs across his back, as does a long pack and a quiver for arrows.  A
shortsword sits tucked to his side.  Florin is deep in thought right
now, else he would most likely stand to acknowledge someone who pays

several small pieces of equipment: a pack, some cookwear, three rolls
and a dagger tucked beneath his belt.  Though he keeps his weapon
close to him and hidden, a faint glint of it shows from beneath his

This dark elf doesn't seem at all in place amidst the others,
though he makes himself as such, and none seem to scorn or bully him
in any way.  He had the dark, wrinkly skin of the drow race, and his
stature is small, though he has a wiry look about him that betrays
skills that are beyond what he appears to have.  He is dressed in
seemingly generic holy garments, though of a darker tint and more
practical than ornate.  In his right hand he wields a septre, as one
would wield a mace, but never does he bring it up.  Upon first looks,
he smiles rather than being introverted.

this one wears forest colors, rather than brightly shimmering metals

perhaps not so common as to discard him completely, for the pick looks
blackened from the blood of demons.  Indeed this dwarf looks as though

This gold elf is dressed in elaborate robes and veils, and is
adorned with many dressings that suggest he is more than just a
commoner.  Indeed, his position as a chancellor of the Elven Court of
Silverymoon is hinted from the crest which bears such an inscription
beneath it.  Why he is here is perhaps not so surprising: it is in the
interest of the remaining Elven Court that their interests in the
ruins of Myth Drannor is maintained, and so along with this
chancellor, the Court has sent out warriors, soldiers, and scouts to
the nearby forests to ensure there is no further threats made against
their way of life.

grow.  The vines move and quiver as the tentacles of a great beast,
seemingly to sense your presence.  Along their lengths are many rows
of jagged thorns, some with bits of fur and cloth still hanging from
them.

A birdlike humanoid stands here selling various things.
~
He is by best estimates a kenku, though his plumage is thinned and
in some places almost resembles bare skin.  He has two miscolored
eyes, one yellow one brown, and several striped colors that radiate
from his yellow eye, which he exemplifies with a leather helm that he
wears half open on that side.  It is a custom job much like the items
he sells, which may change from day to day but are always sought
after, even if some are of questionable quality.

This statue is beautiful, chipped and cracking in places, but her
features are hardly weathered.  A smooth, soft face and small nose
gives her a youthful appearance.  Her arms are forward in a beckoning
pose, palms open as if holding something, but now there is nothing in
her hands.  Her tight fitting dress is scaled in what looks like
sequins, with tasseled knots intertwining her bare legs, and falling
to her feet.  She sits in a basin of water, clear and sparkling
mystical reflections of the Mythal above.  Behind her span two
delicate wings resembling those of a pegasus, but intermingled with
many tiny feathers.

kieras young man dark clothes~
{gK{8i{cer{8a{gs {wthe {yThief{x~
A young man dressed in dark clothes leans against a tree.
~
He is a rather young human, perhaps in his mid 20's with long hair
that is kept neatly in a bunch atop his crown.  He wears a tightly
wound clothing, dark in forest colors, tattered but not dirty.  He
wears his cowl draped below the neck, untied but the ties remain
knotted neatly up to his collar.  He doesn't seem to have any weapons
about him, though there are things concealed beneath his wide belt
which would suggest in the least a dagger.  The most noticeable of his
features is his smile, which he offers to everyone despite their
disposition.  He is at least very content, or is exceedingly effective
at portraying that facade.

{y
He is a tall figure, dark and twisted in likeness, though not of
decaying flesh and bone, but rather of a middle aged human with
deep eyes.  He wears a flesh tinted cowl half draped over white
hair.  His robes are tight fitting his slender, near skeletal
form.  In his hand he holds a shadowy tome from which he reads
his spellcraft.  Despite his almost noble appearance, he is a
lich of pure evil, a fact one can easily forget upon looking
into his eyes.

A large blob of gelling water, magically held together takes shape
out of the rushing water of the fountain.  It takes an almost
serpentine form, reaching around the room exploring.  As you look
closer part of the blob brushes your arm, which passes right through,
leaving your wet sleeve as the only evidence of contact.

credits~
The builder of Dlabraddath and surrounding support areas would like to acknowledge the
following for their help and support in this project.  My only wish is that there were
more people like them around in the MUD gaming community and in a world where such
creativity is oftentimes taken for granted:
{x
{WToby             {y- {8For his work in and around this area.  He is one of the
{8                   greatest builders I know and we have been through many
{8                   projects together over the years.  Building is never
{8                   quite the same without him.
{WSimbul           {y- {8In addition to building aid, was an invaluable resource
{8                   on FR knowledge and an inexhaustable conduit for ideas.
{WBosch, Sahegian  {y- {8For additional support on the builder port during this
{WJehovah            {8project.  All excellent builders who have produced some
{8                   quality areas.
{WTyr              {y- {8Head builder, but even then I found him to be someone I
{8                   could bounce ideas off of and go to anytime I needed a
{8                   second opinion.  He is an irreplaceable staffer here on
{8                   Waterdeep, this port or any other.
{WNisstyre         {y- {8Again, I would be amiss to neglect acknowledgment to him.
{8                   He has produced, directed and co-starred in a game that
{8                   has captivated my attention for over half a decade thus
{8                   far, and has also shown great support in my projects for
{8                   those times when our paths did cross.
{WThe Keepers      {y- {8A family first, a faction second.  They gave me the ideas
{8                   and drive I needed to complete this area and are very
{8                   understanding to the fact that I tell them nothing about
{8                   what I do over here.
{WThe Players      {y- {8Which, if none of the above are you, then this is your
{8                   category right here.  As far as MUD's go, there is no
{8                   single more important aspect than you, the players, for
{8                   beyond the fancy areas, colors, and snazzy code, there is
{8                   nothing without the human interaction.  As such, you are
{8                   my motivation, and the means by which I find inspiration
{8                   to turn over these projects to completion.{x

Dreams and ambitions, from which this place was conceived
Laden with the will to create, it was planned
An area from history, but no history hence was written
Bringing about an empty canvas by which ideas could be sculpted
Rough, unshaped and without purpose, it began
And from this crude beginning came many months of toil
Dauntingly the sculptor chipped away the edges
Driving the chisel with the will to create
And in months of sweat and a year of solace
That which he conceived was born, raised and made whole
Heed these words and tread softly because you tread on my dreams...

[{cAn Excerpt from the Chapter Entitled "Precious Stones"{8]
{x
To our brethren, stones are sacred tears and blood of nature.
They possess the same energy which binds all life, and can
offer to those who carry them certain powers that many attest
can sway fortune to their favor.  What follows is a short
list of some of the more prized stones and their powers:
{g
agate              -          silence, agility, concealment
almadine           -          thought, vitality, inspiration
amethyst           -          serenity, calm, drunkeness
emerald            -          growth, fidelity, abundance
jade               -          hope, ambitions, dreaming
malachite          -          wisdom, clarity, concentration
onyx               -          balance, renewal, redemption
pearl              -          faith, innocence, spirituality
quartz             -          peace, prosperity, guidance
ruby               -          love, strong will, emotion

old stone cistern~
{w
This cistern held water for cooking, bathing and drinking. 
There is a large locking mechanism upon it, which is
strange.  The iron plate which sits bolted the mechanism
is badly rusted.  Below the lock is a faint inscription.
It reads:
{r
{r          Water is sacred, water is locked
{r          But no water sits below this top.
{r          Think a drink and hear the clank.
{r          Sink one's thoughts into this tank.
{r          Say no words, and speak no mind.

In memory of our fallen brother Blasko.
Who marched upon the demons of the ruined
city with his Keeper brethren to dispach
the threat of a great evil and to secure
peace for all the realms.  In doing so,
he paid the highest price, his life and
his blood.  He shall never be forgotten.

{XShattered Street of Axols Run~
~
There seems to be no short supply of architectural styles present
along this walk, with distinctively halfling style houses along either
side here.  The size and simple wooden planks give away much of it,
though the stonework is decidedly gnomish, suggesting there was once
an intermingling of cultures here.  It is something that has never
since caught on, even in our bustling modern world, the humanoid races
prefer to remain for the most part segregated, and perhaps that is our
loss rather than our salvation.

A Rubble Piled Breach in the Wall~
~
Shaundakul avenue ends abruptly at the breach, marking the
beginning of a new avenue and a new ward of the ancient city.  The
once illustrious Gardner's Ride starts here and leads out far across
the ruins.  The characteristic marble slabs are all but demolished
beneath age old battles and centuries of demons trodding upon them. 
It took centuries to quarry these stones, and less time to destroy
them.  The buildings in this part of the city were once of middle
class artisans and merchants, as indicative of the stonework which
remains.  Now, there is only the trees and demon hoardes to occupy
what once was abundant in commerce and societal prosperity.

Crushed Avenue of Gardner's Ride~
~
The street is difficult to walk upon, as it is no longer flat and
smooth.  The creatures roam with an aura of evil about them that makes
you feel uneasy.  It is something in the air that does this, and
perhaps it is some form of psionic energy that draws you away from
them.  Many like the mindflayers use such energy to zone in on strange
beings who would otherwise attempt to pass by unnoticed.  It is thus
imperative that you continue onward, regardless of where.  Just keep
going and perhaps the feeling will pass.

A Narrow Breach in the Wall~
~
There is scarcely a path here, as debris lies all about from a
recent breach in the inner wall.  The breach is narrow; barely wide
enough for two average sized humanoids to enter side by side, yet it
serves as the conduit to a place of mystery: the fabled ward of Myth
Drannor where the races lived together in harmony.  At the foot of the
rubble, the Street of Sorrows begins and continues far to the east
into the southeastern ward.  It makes one wonder what sorrows lie in
store for adventurers brave enough to partake this path.

There are many buildings made of crystal here, which took the worst
damage of all others.  While the stone walls and columns remain, all
that is left of these beautiful crystal architectures are jagged
shards which spread from their foundation like the barbs of a demon's
carapace.  The surface still remains translucent, though blurred and
marred of mud and death.  The avenue continues as a trail of debris
down through the ruins.

A large slab of marble juts from the ground where a rooftop fell
upon the street.  Beneath are piles of bones long picked clean and
bleached from the sun.  Stains of blood marr the marble surfaces and
foul the air as the wind rushes through this avenue to lift the death
up to the surrounding areas.  It is nature's warning and plea of the
innate evil that exists in the realms.

Street of Sorrows~

A large, domed structure stands to the north, still mostly intact,
though the side which faces the Street of Sorrows is opened and caved
in.  Many trees grow along this avenue, as a vast and ancient forest
lies to the south and the newer members growing into the ruins itself.
There are even places where the trees grow out from the middle of the
street, though they remain stunted from lack of room and years to join
the canopy above.

Street of Sorrows~
~
The shattered avenue opens into a large square where two streets
meet.  A smaller street seems to lead to a dead end further south,
where the buildings are stacked one next to the other.  Many are
residential, and their simple styles suggest the artisan classes and
commoners of the N'Tel'Quess.  These buildings are surprisingly in
tact for the most part, though all have most or all of their roofs
destroyed to render them unfit for habitation.

Across the street lies a pile of bricks where once a tower fell. 
Perhaps it fell during the seige when the Army of Darkness first
marched upon this ground, or maybe it was many years later when her
artifice gave way.  Strewn across the debris are remnants of bone,
wood and torn cloth that you cannot begin to imagine the origin of.

from {8r{yot{8t{yin{8g s{yt{8um{yp{8s{x and {8fetid {bwater{x.  The smell of rotten vegetation

It is clear from walking among these remains that this ward of the
city was constructed near the end of its existence.  The architecture
is highly ornate and less refined than historical accounts.  Many of
these were houses of the N'Tel'Quess, who were long attributed as
being the hated race of elves, the ones who caused the Fall of Myth
Drannor, though such accusations were largely embellished and remain
to this day claims of bigotry rather than historical fact.

A now empty fountain crumbles at the center of this intersection. 
Once there was a great {wstatue{x at the center, with many arms and many
pools to catch the streams of water, but now all that is left is the
foundation and a small pool of {cfetid {bwaters{x.  Upon closer inspection,
there are things crawling within, perhaps {8l{yee{8ch{ye{8s{x and {ys{gh{Ra{gm{yb{gl{Ri{gn{yg {8m{ro{8u{rn{8ds{x
of rotten vegetation that could leap out at a moment's notice to latch
onto their {Rprey{x.  Perhaps it is wise not to find out if your
suspicions are true.

quite a few have {ysign{8p{co{8sts{x hanging out towards the street.  A

Street of Sorrows~

The destroyed buildings spill out into the streets along either
side as trees grow from the broken streets where it fell.  This street
was once lined with pillars, and perhaps statues atop them, though all
that remains are the toppled columns that stick out at many odd
angles.  In places, a few remain, though there is no hint at to what
they were for.  The piles of shattered crystal lie scattered at every
few paces, and the once beautifully translucent shards have long been
marred with the mud and flesh of the battles which destroyed this once
proud place.

This is the entrance to the dungeon of Raven's Bluff, or at least a
temporary holding cell.  The passageway here is small and cramped, and
dimly lit by smoky torches along the wall.  It is next to impossible
to see more than ten feet or so away, because of all of the smoke.  To
the east, the passageway continues.  A ladder leads upwards to the
ceiling, then dissapears.

Moontapestry~
~
This short stretch of road is paved from common cobblestones and at
one time planks of wood.  The houses and structures which line the
streets were simple in design and used bricks and stones for most of
the walls, which accounts for why they still remain mostly intact. 
It was the crystal towers and marble temples which took the brunt of
destruction, as they represented all that the Armies of Darkness
despised about the humanoid races.

Moontapestry~
~
Moontapestry ends here at a small cove of once bustling shops and
taverns.  This was a favorite gather place for the southeastern ward,
as evident by the tightly packed buildings and cobblestone walkways. 
There are even places where iron signposts still jut out into the
street, though the signs they once held have long been gone.  At the
far end, the structures have completely collapsed and the southern
Drannor forest has grown in its place.  There is a small trail leading
into the forest where creatures have communed to and from the ruins.

Office of the Head Jailer~
~
This office is nearly empty, so as not to provide escapee's weapons
to aid them in their escape.  There is a desk in the center of the
room, and a single chair, on the other side of the desk, which is
bolted into the cold concrete floor.  There are no windows, and the
only exit is back up the ladder, and through the trapdoor.

Candledance Way ends abruptly here, whether by design or
circumstance.  There are many {cde{8s{gol{8a{cte{x buildings along either side and
some larger ones to the southwest.  The {yco{8bb{ylest{8on{yes{x which make up
this street are largely still in place, though tree roots have since
uplifted many and there is rarely a flat place anymore.  The dense
forest of {RD{rrannor{x surrounds this place in all directions save
northwest.

A Desolate Shop~

The gutted remains of this once prominent shop looms over the
ancient street of Moontapestry as a testament to the Fall.  Three of
the four walls stand, the fourth partially collapsed.  Display cases
and shelves lie toppled and piled in heaps across the room, while all
around the echoes of demonic shrieks sound across the barren walls.

The Street of Sorrows ends abruptly here at a collapsed pile of
rubble.  It may have continued further, but you cannot, at least not
without climbing the jagged shards of crystal and stones.  The forest
rises over to the east and all around, suggesting there is little to
see past this place.  A large building stands mostly in one piece just
to the north, and the desecrated fountain at the entrance suggests it
was once home to a prominent person.

One prominent feature along this section of the road is the massive
Keep that stands to the south.  It seems of a totally different
architectural style and still maintains an iron gate, though the
timbers of it have long ago rotted away.  This may have been where the
final battles were fought, though the gate remains closed and secured,
suggesting there is still something inside that was worth locking
away.  Smaller buildings lie on the other side of the street,
including a small guild hall and multi-storied pub.

There seems to be no short supply of architectural styles present
along this walk, with distinctively halfling style houses along either
side here.  The size and simple wooden planks give away much of it,
though the stonework is decidedly gnomish, suggesting there was once
an intermingling of cultures here.  It is something that has never
since caught on, even in our bustling modern world, the humanoid races
prefer to remain for the most part segregated, and perhaps that is our
loss rather than our salvation.

On this rather long stretch of crippled road, there is little to

were.  The demons prevent a good vantage point, and their screeches do
even less for the peace and quiet, though these ruins have heard
nothing else for thousands of years.  It is somewhat sad to walk
amidst such destruction, yet nature still thrives in her own way, as
the trees tower above many of the buildings and shade the streets
where their eaves once did.

This small avenue was once highly decorated with ivory pillars and
statues.  It is evident that this was a prominent walk of the city,
though now nothing remains aside from broken pedistals and fallen
columns.  The street was once paved in marble and lined in silver, now
desecrated and overgrown.  There stands an ancient keep structure
nearby, and from the looks of it, it remained largely in tact.  The
door is even closed and secured as if it was never opened.

The street opens up into a crude square where there once sat a
fountain, though now it is dry and teeming with leeches and evil
vegetation.  A sparkle can be seen between the rocks that now sit in
this pool, and perhaps there is treasure left here untouched.  To the
northwest, there is a long stretch of steps leading up onto a small
ridge.  The steps were once of dark marble but now they are shattered
and cracked beneath the weight of the toppled buildings all around. 
In places they crumble and fall to a dangerous landing down below.

po{8li{wsh{Wed {wma{8rb{xle and glazed {yterra {rcotta{x.  In the height of this city's
elegance, there were hundreds of artisans representing all of the

The buildings crowd together like a bustling metropolis, though
only in sections here in the new ward.  This marks the center of the
ward, where the local governing bodies once held residence, and it was
here that some of the first and fierces battles took place to defend
the city.  As such, there remains almost nothing to show what
magnificence once took hold, though the demons take little interest in
the soft silver and copper that once lined the towers and temples, and
now lay scattered in pieces all about.

Amidst the shattered remains of the city, there are forces unknown
that cloud your mind and play games with your senses.  It could be
psionic auras that some of the creatures possess, though the odds are
that the forces which cause them are so complex, no rational
explanation can be found.  Above looms the radiance of what can only
be the mythal, as no sky looks this way anywhere else in the realms. 
There is magic here, no doubt, but whether good or evil, you do not

perch upon the jagged walls.  Below the ridge here is a pile of rubble

from here.  The buildings, though devestated, hint at a higher class
with their decorative masonry and more elaborate spire structures of

buildings, and shadow them in darkness.  The cries of demons can be
heard all around and there is an uneasy feeling in the air that
saturates this place like a broken heart.

This street, known as Evening Star, was once a central walkway of
the patrons of Myth Drannor as more streets branch out on either side
as far as the eye can see.  Small buildings, now in ruin, lie
scattered along both ends, suggesting that this part of the city was a
quiet and humble place before fate unraveled it.  These buildings were
people's homes, their very lives, and all that remain are near empty
shells and indiscernable piles of rubble.  Near empty, for trees and
demons now inhabit them, and they seem far from ready to give up their
claim.

Soldier's Cut was once a quiet walk through the wooded part of Myth
Drannor, but now it remains a dangerous place to be.  Even amidst the
buildings, there were places one could find safety if ever they had
the demons at their back, but here there are only the trees and the
shade, where a humanoid's senses are impaired but a demons are
heightened.  This road was once paved in smooth riverstones from the
nearby Glyrryrl River, which is now infested with dangerous fish,
leeches, and festering plantlife.  The trees here grow to dizzying
heights, being among the oldest in the area, as they were left in tact
while the nearby forests were ravaged.

On this rather long stretch of crippled road, there is little to
see aside from the rows of free standing walls where once buildings
were.  The demons prevent a good vantage point, and their screeches do
even less for the peace and quiet, though these ruins have heard
nothing else for thousands of years.  It is somewhat sad to walk
amidst such destruction, yet nature still thrives in her own way, as
the trees tower above many of the buildings and shade the streets
where their eaves once did.

The street is difficult to walk upon, as it is no longer flat and
smooth.  The creatures roam with an aura of evil about them that makes
you feel uneasy.  It is something in the air that does this, and
perhaps it is some form of psionic energy that draws you away from
them.  Many like the mindflayers use such energy to zone in on strange
beings who would otherwise attempt to pass by unnoticed.  It is thus
imperative that you continue onward, regardless of where.  Just keep
going and perhaps the feeling will pass.

More trees than building remains line this small avenue as it
curves to the northwest.  Judging by their size and species, they are
as ancient as the earlier buildings, and grew here long before the
Fall.  The flowers and plants which grow along every cracked surface
are of the most brilliant colors of red, violet, and yellow, though
they are also of the most deadly known in all of Cormanthyr.  It seems
that evil begets evil, and these pernicious plants have made a home
among the creatures and devestation.

Here, Gardner's Ride curves towards a deeply overgrown part of the
ruins.  Many bright flowers and plants grow along and on the roadway
despite the creatures which serve it heavy foot traffic.  An old
saying goes that the more vibrant and exotic the colors, the more
dangerous the plant is.  At least here, this is grounded in facts, as
these plants are capable of shooting poisonous barbs or deadly spores
upon being disturbed.  It is something you do not wish to find out for
yourself.

Gardner's way curves sharply here as it joins with the neighboring
forest.  There is a small clearing between the forest and the street
that allows access to and fro.  A stone foundation can be scarcely
seen amidst the grass and saplings.  Nothing large has yet taken root
there, though a corner has started to lift up from the roots of a
nearby oak.

Where once the mythal served the elves and residents of Myth
Drannor, it now serves the demons and evil creatures that remain
beneath its shroud.  As a result, they are unnaturally strong and live
nearly an eternity here, which is incentive enough to remain and
defend their stake in the ruins.  To stay alive, they often resort to
killing one another, and their bones pile in heaps along the avenues
as the stench of rotten meat saturates the air.

Amidst the shattered remains of the city, there are forces unknown
that cloud your mind and play games with your senses.  It could be
psionic auras that some of the creatures possess, though the odds are
that the forces which cause them are so complex, no rational
explanation can be found.  Above looms the radiance of what can only
be the mythal, as no sky looks this way anywhere else in the realms. 
There is magic here, no doubt, but whether good or evil, you do not
know.

This small room once boasted a beautiful crystal chandelier and
many clothing racks from which hung the very best wares that this shop
had to offer anyone who could pay the exhuberent price.  Now, there is
nothing save a few busted boards and a pile of broken glass scattered
about.  The only uplifting feeling that this room provides is that it
was too well locked up for the demons to defile.  All of this debris
was happenstance to the fall.

You stand in the foyer of a once magnificent library, now in ruins.
The walkway was once lined in marble and onyx with metallic trim,
which has long been plundered by monsters and demons to fill their
dens and caverns.  There is little left aside from a few sparse piles
of stone, wood and broken glass and the remnants of books and scrolls
that none but the civilized would value and thus has been left
untouched.  A collapsed doorway to the east hints at another room,
though it is a precarious walkway to traverse from all the debris.

Before Nanchans Tower~

The crumbling buildings open the way to this overgrown garden of
sorts.  A spiraling walkway leads up to the foot of a large tower,
which is partially collapsed but still standing through the centuries.
The wild growing plants surround you yet do not grow along the stone
walkway.  They are barred from growing there by some unknown force
which seems to saturate the air.  There is a feeling of something
enchanted as you approach the tower's base.

Remains of Nanchans Tower~
~
The main floor of the small tower seems to be structurally intact,
or at least you can't tell the illusion from the reality around you. 
Most of the room is destroyed, torn paintings hang from two of the
walls, and wrecked furniture lies about the room, although it seems
the mythal keeps the fibres themselves from rotting completely.  This
room once seemed to be some sort of a reception room, for guests, or
clients of some sort.  Dominating much of the west wall is what seems
to be a large window, although its view; bright noonday sun shining
across a soaring stone and crystal cityscape, is certainly not the
hellish city you just found refuge from.  A set of stone circular
stairs in the corner lead up to the next level of the tower, and the
door back to the city is east.

Remains of Nanchans Tower~
~
The second story of this so called tower has been all but
demolished.  The roof has been torn off, and piecemeal chunks of the
stone walls are all that remain.  It's hard to judge with such little
stonework left, but it appears this floor had a much lower ceiling,
more attuned to a gnomish living space than the airy room below. 
Splashes of dried paint cover parts of the floor, and one or two
smashed jars lie in pieces about the floor.  This room was likely the
living, and working space for these gnomish artists.  The beautiful
window illusions that adorned so many walls across the city were
created right here.

This was once a marvelously large and elegant hall, complete with a
domed ceiling and pillared foyer that now lies in ruin.  A central
island fountain still stands with what remains of an ivory statue of a
beast tamer among a herd of wild cats.  The pool is dry and the ivory
is cracked and remnants lay all about.  A large stairway which once
granted access to the upper level, now destroyed, still stands towards
the back.  The hall opens up to several rooms, though most all open to
the outside or to nothing but debris.  One doorway to the north seems
to open to a bright garden unlike anything else you have seen.

You find text engraved on a newly placed cornerstone that had been
carefully concealed under debris from all but the most discerning:
{x
{c    This place represents a paradox that time has perhaps not
{c    been so forgiving as to prevent from repeating. Here, the
{c    Guild of Naturalists once convened.  They embodied all of
{c    the ideas of Myth Drannor:  the discovery, protection and
{c    sharing of knowledge and good will.  Their interests were
{c    focused on the study of animals and their behaviour which
{c    led to much progress in the way of ranger lore.  While it
{c    was under good auspicions that they operated, the end did
{c    not necessarily justify their means for their secrecy and
{c    elitist isolation led to the weakened state of Cormanthyr.
{x
{8    This stone remains in place as a warning to whom may read
{8    of it.  Let not our actions inadvertently harm that which
{8    we strive so hard to accomplish through pride and secrecy.
{x
{8    Forever remember these Naturalists and what happened here.
{x
There are seven quizzical words which border the cornerstone:
{8        Courage, Humility, Creativity, Compassion
                 Wisdom, Sacrifice, Truth{x

still standing over this part of the ruins.  Though a precarious walk,

Just below the ridge, there is this overgrown pile of rubble.  In
places, the soil has renewed and sprouted up exotic vegetation and
flowering plants.  They grow with long, poisonous thorns and prickles
and bright colors to ward off those who would violate their claim. 
The shattered stones lie all around like monuments to the ill fated
City of Beauty, yet here life has reclaimed what civilization sought
to perfect.  It is the dichotomous union of good and evil, of life and
death that makes the ruins more than a place of lost hope and despair.

It is clear from walking among these remains that this ward of the
city was constructed near the end of its existence.  The architecture
is highly ornate and less refined than historical accounts.  Many of
these were houses of the N'Tel'Quess, who were long attributed as
being the hated race of elves, the ones who caused the Fall of Myth
Drannor, though such accusations were largely embellished and remain
to this day claims of bigotry rather than historical fact.

A Breach in the Wall~
~
Rubble lines either side of this forsaken street as a collapsed
section of wall lies just to the south of here.  There is scarcely a
hint of street here as as the trees have canopied it from centuries of
growth.  The street is badly damaged and there is barely a place to
stand amidst the upturned stones and overgrowing vegetation.  A small
path has been recently dug out from a pile of rubble, and mixed among
the shattered crystal, marble, and stone are remnants of bone and
leather and a putrid smell of foulness.  To the south, the devestated
ruins of the old realms stand, and this street, partially excavated,
allows access to the once unreachable ruins to the north and west. 
There is little hint at what may lie further along this avenue, but
certainly there is still some magic left in this forgotten place.

The piles of stone rise high here as the remainder topples over the
ridge like a waterfall.  This was once a part of the Manysteps, but
now little remains of them aside from shattered fragments of the once
polished marble which made up each step.  The stones atop are from an
ancient tower which has long since separated and fallen apart from
what it once was.  Though difficult to climb, there does remain a low
spot between the rubble where a tree has grown and since died.  It
links the Manysteps to the overgrown piles of rubble below the ridge.

from the rubble which were once used to support the stones that

world, though the scarcity of ores would possibly render it useless
anyway.  Such is the possibilities of ingenuity when not bound by the
limits of resources, and there may never be another place like Myth
Drannor to exist in the realms.

This ridge is the tallest natural formation in the southern ward of
the ruins.  It looks out over the remnants of Myth Drannor in a
breathtaking view.  There stands many columns and free standing walls
that look like a child's game of ivory topples, yet they are more
sturdy than they seem to have survived so long.  Far to the north, the
crystal spires of the ancient ward still rise surprisingly in tact,
though their symmetry has long been shattered from the ancient seiges.

now the few, as the remnants of marble and granite crumble beneath
you.  Along either side, there is a dangerous drop off, and the stone

The marble steps are marred with stains of war and destruction.  These
stones have seen much lost over the centuries, yet they remain
vigilant to stand tall amidst the center of despair.

which infest this once beautiful place, and they are the epitome of
evil and destruction for those who hold this place dear to their

These steps rise abruptly and curve sharply either by design or

school of wizardry.  There were once two magnificient towers rising up
over Dlabraddath, but now only half of one remains open to the sky. 
The other has long been toppled over the southwestern manysteps and
destroyed them.  There is surprisingly no sign of any demons or
creatures atop this ridge, given the vantage it has over the ruins.

stands here amidst the demons who dared to climb the ridge in defiance.
The single standing tower is split across and lies open to the heavens,
though it still remains as the tallest structure in Dlabraddath. There
is a large, timbered door which has been recently restored and remains
fastened to the entrance amidst several pillared wardstones which help
keep the demons at bay. It has no affect on you as you can pass freely.{x

Tall trees and overhanging vines grow in this glade which has remained through
the ages as a haven for life in the belly of despair.  Some of them still bear
the charred scars of fire and weapons of war, though time has taken most of it
away. A few of the original plants still grow in isolated patches, though only
in isolated patches. These are priceless to those who know and can get to them.{x

At the upper most branch which you can reach, this tree pierces the
canopy of Drannor Forest, affording you a view of the vastness of
these lands.  All around you stretch a blanket of forest canopy
overshadowed by neighboring mountains and the ominous loom of a
strange, rainbow aura which stretches across the sky.  Nearby to the
north, the ruins of the ancient city rise high above, as cracked
crystal obelisks sparkle in a million points of brilliance.  Not to
neglect such a magnificent view, but all around you shriek the hideous
humanoid faced birds which you seem to have stumbled upon.

This small room is dark and featureless.  It seems to have been
sealed away from the rest of the ruins inasmuch as it remains
remarkably unharmed from demon hands.  At the center of the room is a

A large skeleton of a once formidable demon breaks out of the
water here and leans against a tree trunk as if gasping for
freedom from the murky waters.  It is covered in vegetation and
small insects, though the slimy tendons still hang from the
yellowed bone, suggesting that it is not as old as one might
think.  You wonder what could have taken down such a large
creature, or perhaps you do know, for it is the swamp itself

To the south is the familiar sight of the ancient road that
cuts through the eastern part of the ruins.  It is built upon
a high point such that the swamp waters scarcely spill out
over its ancient stonework.  The plants and strange creatures
which dwell in this swamp seem to steer clear of the road, as
if bound here, or as if fearful of the demons which roam the
ruins in search of food.  By the same token, the demons do not
venture into the swamps, for some reason as yet unknown.{x

Deep witin the Glim Gardens swamp, you find yourself without
direction, as in every direction, the scene is the same:  black,
murky waters and tall, ominous trees repeating into haze and
darkness.  It is difficult to tell whether it is night or day
beneath the darkness, which seems to loom even in places where
there are very few trees.  Several tips of a ribcage jut out
from the water, testament to the fall of a large beast which
once wandered into these swamps and were claimed by the ruins,
as is the case with many things here.{x

The air is quiet of noise, save the sound of bubbling swamp
gas and the occasional screech of demonic intent echoing from
the ruined city.  There is an occasional rustle of vegetation
coming to life upon sensing a presence in their swamp, though
once in motion, the plants are silent, only their everpresent
swaying toward you is evidence that they are still alive. To
the west one can scarcely make out an incline and a clearing
upon which an ancient road is built that cuts through this

remained surprisingly intact over the centuries.  The clay tiles of
the roof crack beneath your weight, and there is a dizzying feeling of
vertigo as you look out over the crumbling streets below.  There are
several patches where tiles have fallen and at the apex of the eaves
there is a strange looking weathervane...  {x

You wander into a small clearing in the forest.  Here the sunlight
shines brightly upon the ground, which remains strangely barren and
flat.  A strong breeze circles here, almost unnatural as the leaves
retreat to the forest walls about.  At the center of the clearing,
there is the hint of a stone slab.

The wall opens into a small entranceway that lies
deep in a foot or two of murky water.  Underneath
the slime, one can make out what looks to be some
draconian mosaic adorning the entry slab. A stone
door sits within the entranceway with just a hint
of a crack that divides the slab down the middle,
suggesting that it can in fact be opened.  Across
this door is a seal:  round with jagged edges and
adorned with strange runes depicting the wavelike
lithographs, commonly used to represent some kind
of psionic power: three arches of increasing size
drawn away from a circle.  The skull which adorns
the center of the seal suggests that the door was
sealed by the undead, or perhaps to keep the dead.{x

their toll.  Some depict the once beautiful streets of Myth Drannor,
while others depict many different scenes such as a forest, a room of
glass, and a vast stretch of mountains.  Common to all is the likeness
of a beautiful female gnome, grasping a paintbrush and smiling with a
mischevious grin.  Strewn about on the ground are many bowls of dried
paint and makeshift brushes fashioned from sticks and hair.  Torn
cloth lies about, as does a stale odor as that which can be smelled in
tombs and catacombs.

You break through a thick wall of growth and stumble upon a
stone wall.  The wall is ancient, though not as old as those
in the ruins, and definitely not of elven craft.  Skulls and
demonic faces adorn the surface and there are claw marks from
demons who stumbled upon it over the centuries.  The trees
grow over it and the vegetation around it, concealing it from
most of the hoards.  The wall stretches east and west, though
both ways are completely overgrown in dense vegetation.{x

with an eerie motion.  The skeletons of dead birds lie scattered up
the wall, as if it were flypaper for them.  Logs jut from the surface
of the dark green waters as tombstones in a decrepit cemetary and all
manner of vines and vegetation dips low from the tree branches above

dangerous insects and creatures you cannot even begin to identify, but
judging by their sharp fangs and claws, you fear they are not things

unusual fish swimming about, almost indifferent of the horrors that

they are well adept at defending themselves.  Little else catches your

if something were holding it back.  From through the trees, tall piles
of rubble can be seen, and there are devilish shrieks which echo from
the northern ruins.  One of the knights stands guard here, protective
of the hidden route into the inner ruins.

More tents stand to the east of here.  The forest looms to the west
like a wall of darkness that seems foreboding and unsafe.  To the
north is a small guard post, and what looks like a narrow path into
the forest, towards the ruined city.  If such a path led into the
ruins, it would be the easiest way to access them thus far found by
anyone, though such a prospect seems too good to be true.  The path
continues north and south.

The ground here is barren and hard, having been made that way from
heavy foot traffic.  This encampment is elaborate for something so far
from any settlements.  The tents are large and seemingly comfortable. 
The pathways are free of large rocks, which were unearthed to line
them on both sides.  There are even pails set out along the pathway
for the waste boys to carry to the forest.  The setup is elaborate,
though there is a sense of equality here, suggesting that this small
camp flourishes on everyone working together to do their part.  The
pathway veers north here, and continues east toward Drannor forest.

These tents are larger than the others, and they remain closed
where the others were not.  Three are here, interconnected, and bear
the symbol of the Knights along the side, suggesting that the more
important members of the group call these their home.  A large sword
stands upright at the entrance, the purpose of which is uncertain, but
most likely a symbol of status, or perhaps a secret message to the
others of some unknown event or passage of time.  The thick growth of
the eastern forest begins just passed the tents, forming a near
impenetrable wall.  The path through the encampment is back to the

The clearing ends along a circle of tall trees, which forms a
somewhat natural wall between this encampment and the forest to the
east.  Somewhat natural in that the countless clusters of stumps all
about suggests there was nothing natural about it.  The felled trees
are used for much of the makeshift fencing and supports for the tents,
which are part canvas cloth and part wood skeleton.  They are built
for the long term, having been patched countless times over the years,
but nothing major as apparent by the original stitching that still
adorns the seams.  The encampment path is back to the west.

Amidst the lightheartedness of the people of this encampment, there
is real danger just a few leagues north, as the looming shadows of
fallen towers and broken spires weigh heavy upon every eye that looks
that way.  The Knights who live here are close friends, adventurers
sworn to protect those who are foolish enough to venture into the
ruins unprepared.  They have a sense of fellowship about them, though
they remain always at arms and always alert for potential danger. 
This encampment seems to have been here for years, and is well guarded
by it's occupants.  It feels safe here.  The forest pathway continues

shimmering in a veil of colors that is both supernatural and soothing.

where several tents are clustered.  The tents are fairly large, able
to hold several people and still have room to do other things aside
from sleeping.  There are three tents here, which surround a large
firepit which smolders from a previous night of burning.  Several
irons still jut from within, warming for reasons unknown.  There are
logs set about the pit, stripped of bark and worn smooth from
continued use as a sitting place.  To the east are more tents, while

These tents are somewhat larger than those that can be seen to the
northwest of here, though not quite as large as those to the far east,
which tower to what appears to be double layers.  No less than five
support beams hold each of these tents up, and the tents are clustered
three per lot, with two lots in each of these small clearings that
branch from the central pathway through the encampment.  There are few
weapons about, suggesting this is not an army, or at least not one
that leaves weapons lying around.  Indeed the people that pass by seem
well-armed and heavily armored and quite able to defend themselves
should the need ever arise.  Though these tents provide little in the
way of defense, there is only a small chance that any enemies
broaching on this place would ever reach that far in.

Just north of the main walk are several tents, clustered together
about a firepit, some crafting tables, and a few small animal pens. 
The ground about them is scattered in stumps, suggesting that this
clearing was not originally natural.  Many of the stumps have since
been used as foundations for some makeshift structures, including a
crafting table upon which sits several long strips of iron.  Those who
pass by seem well armored, and very few of them look to be ill ready
to hold their own in a confrontation.  This encampment doesn't seem to
be for war, however, as there is little left in these lands to go to
war against, save the demons which call the northern ruins their home.

The small cluster of tents line the northern wall of trees beyond

consisting of a few long stakes, several layers of cloth canvas, and
ropes to hold everything in place.  In places, ropes have been
reknotted, suggesting that continued maintenance has been done over
time to keep the tents standing.  There is a narrow, barren footpath
connecting the cluster to the main walkway which is lined on both
sides by medium sized stones.  The grass is trimmed low to the ground,
suggesting that the growth is constantly being checked by the few
animals which are allowed to graze within this secret encampment.  The

no taller than three paces, and upon closer inspection, they
all bear an inscription as would be seen upon a grave marker.

{x
In the age after the fall...
{x
When it seemed as though no further injustice could be done to the once
beautiful Myth Drannor, a dark lich rose up to seize the reigns of corruption
and bring the great city to humiliation.  In the second age after the fall,
they called the lich Druth Daern and his domination over all that was defiled
and desolate was absolute.  He had near complete dominance over the ruins of
Myth Drannor and raped the city for whatever spoils it had left to trickle--
what little was spared by Baator's minions and the Army of Darkness. Druth
did what the others that lusted after the city failed to do for his portfolio
was that of manipulation.  Using psionic necromancy, he controlled the warring
powers, and while Druth Daern hid among the temple ruins within the great
gardens of the ruined city, the other powers that fought for control of the
city were pitted against one another, and Druth Daern reveled in the chaos he
had ensued.  The Baatezu and Tanar'ri were of the most fierce of adversaries,
greatest in numbers and most lustful of all the powers in their desire to kill
one another.  Taking their eternal blood feud to this world, they fought
relentless for millenia within the fading shroud of the Mythal: forever
pushing their precarious lines back and forth across the city as more of their
kind poured forth from the Abysmal portals that lied hidden away amongst the
toppled towers and shattered spires.  In that way, their numbers were forever
being replenished, and as such they were the biggest threat to Druth Daern's
plan...
{x
Or so he thought.

A Tome Entitled "The Dark Lich of Myth Drannor. Vol. II"
{x
The lich reveled in the game he played.  He held full dominance over their
actions, those weak-minded demons of Myth Drannor, and at the drop of a helm,
he could pit one side against the other and watch as the blood spilled across
the elven granite.  For over a century he played the game:  waging Tanar'ri
against Baatezu, allowing one side to ally with the lesser Yugoloths and Slaadi
just long enough to even the numbers out and then switching focus to the other
side, while watching in delight as the alliances fell in hatred and bloodshed.
He played his hand when he could, controlling weak-minded adventurers to
explore places he himself could not and compelling the poor soul back to his
temple to relinquish the spoils to the lich and his minions.  As often the case
then as it is now, few adventurers would make it through the ruins alive, and
so Druth would seek the mind of another able body to control, willing them to
pick up the treasure and continue onward with no regard for their life. 
Through six or seven shells, he would have his treasure, adding to his vaults,
of which overflowed with the wealth of the city.  In all this, he twisted as
many minds as he could find, but even then his sights were too narrow to see his
own downfall.  For while he compelled the demons, the lower creatures, and the
ill-fated adventures that would set foot within his sphere of influence, he
forgot about the other psionics that sat in silence, also lusting after the
ruins.  Of them were the beholders, the alhoons, and above all, the phaerimm,
who watched and waited for Druth Daern to miscalculate.
{x
And in the third age Druth Daern let his guard down.

{x
The bloody tug-of-war that waged for most of the third age came to an end
abruptly with a massive war of the two denizens of the Lower Plains, and at the
reigns was Druth Daern himself to orchestrate the bloodshed.  Druth had grown
bored with his game, and set his sights on the ward further north and west in
the city.  He had near complete dominance over the two lower wards, known in
the elven tongue as Cormanthor and Dlabraddath, but weak was his dominance over
the ward that lied far from his temple.  He became greedy over Kerradunath and
Sheshyrinnam, where dwelled the phaerimm in secret and whose powers shielded
his stake to their claim.  When Druth nearly annihilated the demon numbers, he
set his undead army to the west in hopes of finalizing his claim to Myth Drannor.
To his surprise, his army was annhiliated by the phaerimm, who in that time had
allied with a greater god who took vengeance against Druth Daern for the killing
of his minions.  The Dark Lord of Baator opened the Heptagram Portal of Nessus
and entered this realm to challenge Druth Daern, not for dominance over Myth
Drannor, but for revenge.  His hellstone sealed in the Nine Hells, Baator was
near immortal, and fought his way to Druth Daern's necrotic temple where he
shattered the lich's phylactery and forever bound Druth to the temple where he
had hid in cowardice.  His vengeance satisfied, Baator returned to the Nine
Hells to escape the foulness of our realms and to spawn his minions to replenish
those numbers he had lost to the lich.
{x
At the end of the third age, this moment was seized by the phaerimm.

Seeing that the eastern wards of Myth Drannor was no longer under Druth Daern's
power, and the demon numbers were dwindled to only handfuls here and there, the
phaerimm staked their claim over the lower ward of Dlabraddath and held up
residence in an abandoned keep.  The phaerimm knew something that Baator did not:
Druth Daern's phylactery was but one of several that in that time were hidden in
unknown places throughout the ruins.  The destruction of his largest plylactery,
the phylactery of life, forever weakened Druth's powers, but fell short of
destroying the lich, who over time would rise up again and threaten the
phaerimm's control over the eastern ruins.  To protect their claim, the phaerimm
imprisoned the lifeforce of Druth Daern within his necrotic seal which adorned
the ceremonial chamber of his twisted temple.  The phaerimm sorcerors locked it
using no less than twelve minor seals, which could only be unlocked by a key
made from one of the pieces of Druth's Daern's shattered phylactery.  The
fragments were scattered in the lower ruins, many of which have since been
recovered.  With but one piece, a key can be made for one of the minor seals. The
details of this ritual was recorded by one of the last remaining Court Mages of
the last Elven Court of Myth Drannor, and in her care this dangerous knowledge was
entrusted.  Those seeking such knowledge would be fools, for while it is only
Druth Daern himself that can open the vaults to his treasure, unleashing such a
beast upon our world would certainly bring about great turmoil and destruction.
In the end, Druth Daern remains bound in his temple, the phaerimm remain dominant
over the southern ward, and the demons continue to fight one another, as the
lesser powers make their moves whenever they can.  Thus is the way of the fourth
age, the current age, when Myth Drannor remains in ruin and shrouded in evil.
{x
It is also in the fourth age that a great evil grows inside.

You step out into the beauty of daylight, from an opening half
concealed at the base of an ancient, elven statue.  This place
is a tiny island, made of stone and marble, about it spans the
deep waters of Glyrryrl's Pool. This is the deepest one can go
into the ruins of Myth Drannor the noble's ward of Kerradunath.
About you spans the ruins, tall spired structures of shattered
crystal stacked one behind the other as far as the eye can see.
The pool about this isle is clear, radiant and still full with
elven magic. Above you flickers a chromatic veil of the Mythal,
fading but still alive in chaos magic.  A crumbling but strong
wall bars access to the rest of the isle, north, east and west
of here, but to the south there is a way leading down to water,
down to the likes of Glyrryrl's Pool...{x

The dawning of this new evil brings the return of the elves, humans, dwarves,
and the fellowship of many races united in the cause of good.  They came to the
ruins first as being lured by fame and fortune, but later by the growing presence
from which they were compelled.  The psionic voices call to them from outside the
ruins, their influence now spread far, calling them to their doom within.  The
origin of these voices is unknown, as is their purpose for existing.  In the end
of the fourth age, there came a group known as the Keepers of Antiquity, to combat
this evil for the purpose of preserving their way of life.  They believed it to be
a threat not only to their cause, but to the entire realm, as over the years the
voices have grown stronger, until one day it began to reach out to their elder
leader, who had set up residence on the outskirts of the western forest of Drannor.
Beckoned by the awakening of the phaerimm, he became the impetus for that which has

The once magnificent buildings of this great city of beauty is

of elven magic still present in this winged woman. Her face is
a mirror to your truest form, her bosom grows and wanes with a
wind of life's breath, and her body is a testament to greatest

apart as the centuries have seen happen naturally.  Only in
places are there discontinuity, be it the occasional rotting

soft and blanketed with many seasons of leaves and soft mosses.
This place almost feels as a sanctuary, though wild animals and

The forest canopy opens up in this part, revealing the sun and sky
in all her glory.  A small encampment has been made here, with a
circle of stones and piles of branches, leaves and berries.  Some logs
have been piled to the northern end of the clearing, seemingly to keep
wild animals away, though there looks to be a hint of blood on them as
if their use was found early on.  Near the campfire, there is a woman.

The trees rise high, taking their place among the giants. They
have been here so long that every one remains equally spaced
apart as the centuries have seen happen naturally.  Only in
places are there discontinuity, be it the occasional rotting
stump or young growth from some mishap long ago. The ground is
soft and blanketed with many seasons of leaves and soft mosses.
This place almost feels as a sanctuary, though wild animals and
a sense of mystery prevent it from being totally benign.

This was once an important smithy, as evident by the generous
amount of space and masonry used to build the complex.  Bare nails and
rusted chains are all that hang from the walls now, though at the far
wall there is a series of wooden shelves that have been recently
placed and filled with various tools and metals.  A large human man
stands here behind the comparably large anvil, which sits in the
center of the smithy layered in centuries of rust and neglect. 
Immediately to the side of the anvil is a large firepit where an iron
crucible sits.  The anvil has been tipped slightly at an angle such
that whatever is placed atop it can slide into the pit.

damp wood saturates the air.  Most of the forest is filled with
relatively new growth, not inidicative to the actual age of these
lands, suggesting that there was a time in its history that this
forest was created, or perhaps recreated.  There are subtle hints to
the latter: ancient {yst{rum{gps{x splintered by a great force now centuries

expanse of vividly colored vegetation grows everywhere here,
from stone pathways to the pillared banister rails that sect
the terraced sanctum. Each terrace descends down towards the
center of the courtyard, where sits a crystal clear fountain
gathering into a deep pool that reflects each thought caught
by the Mythal above. Statues litter this garden, many broken
or defaced, revealing intricate detail at the breaks down to
every bone and tendon and even thick trickes of blood carved
into the stone. An illusion of emptyness garnishes the banks
of walling about this place questioning whether this is real.{x

stairs, collecting in a pool in the corner.  Up the walls around the
room grows a glowing blue-green moss, with the water below taking on
some of its color.  Between the bits of moss are several etchings,
seemingly water blasted into the stone.  A large hole carved in the
north wall appears to lead to another room beyond.

#24263
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "refine"~

say I have studied the art for many years, and now only handle the {Mmastery metals{m.
say Which, I might add is a feat in and of itself.
mob echo $I pauses to relish in his self-flattery.
say The art is so beautiful and rewarding, that I have all but turned my back on {Mbase metals {mand {Mprecious metals{m.

~
#24264
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "mastery metals"~
say The {Mmastery metals{m as we call them are those that cannot be reduced by normal means.
say They are the enchanted ores of mithril, adamantium, and ebony.
say Few {Malloys{m of these metals have been discovered, but those that exist I will not {Mrefine{m.
say {MAlloys{m take a special know how that I have yet to fully grasp.
say Not to mention it is a challenge I neither have the patience nor tools for.
say Anyway, these are the three I will {Mrefine{m for you, but my {Mprice{m is not trivial.
~
#24265
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "base/precious metals"~
say I do not bother with {Mrefining{m the {Mbase metals{m or even the {Mprecious metals{m.  
say The {Mbase metals{m are the ores of iron, copper, tin, and lead.
say The {Mprecious metals{m are the ores of silver, gold and platinum.
say But I come from a long line of artisans of which many know how to refine.
say Perhaps if you are looking for a service I cannot offer, you should seek out {Mmore like me{m.
~
#24266
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "more about refining"~
say {MRefining{m is a beautiful and rewarding art.  It is also a very {Museful{m service.
say I can take an item regardless of size and reduce it back to its raw composition.
say For example, give me an iron bracer and I will {Mrefine{m it to pure iron
say For a {Mprice{m of course, but with a little knowledge, you will find it reasonable.
say And it goes without saying that the item is destroyed, so once you hand it to me, there is no going back.
say Make sure what you give me is what you wanted to give me!
~
#24267
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "useful"~
say Yes, you heard me. {MRefining{m can be very {Museful{m.
say It is a cheap alternative to obtaining pure ores readily from old junk items or what not.
say Though sometimes people will ask for beautiful things to be destroyed, which is a shame.
say Then again, I'm not their mothers, so I abide by their wishes and {Mrefine{m it regardless of state.
mob echo $I turns his head and ponders his statement.
say But anyway, the raw ores I make can be used by {Mother smiths{m to make items once again.
say Now, don't ask me about these {Mother smiths{m, because honestly I haven't gotten out much.
say So are you interested in having me {Mrefine{m an item, or would you like to hear {Mmore about refining{m?
~
#24268
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "more like me"~
say I am pleased to see you are interested in my trade.
say {MRefining{m is one of many techniques that stem from the study of {Malchemy{m.
say It is often difficult to obtain raw and pure ores, and so alchemists asked us smiths for help.
say And from that request, we learned and perfected refinery.
say I like to think of it as the end result of the marriage of {Malchemy{m and smithing.
say And aside from {Malchemy{m, these ores are very {Museful{m as raw materials to make other items.
say Give a learned smithy a combination of raw ores, and they can make for you wonderful {Malloys{m.
~
#24269
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "alchemy"~
say What? Have times changed that much since I've been away?
say {MAlchemy{m is the trade..science..art..what have you, that deals with transmutating {Mbase metals{m to {Mprecious metals{m.
say The alchemist believes all metals share a common aether, a quintessential element that can link them with the proper process.
say Imagine turning an ordinary chunk of iron into platinum, or mithril!
say But of course, I've yet to see a transmutation that drastic be demonstrated.
say Still, it has great potential, and as long as there are alchemists, there will be a demand for services like mine!
smile
~
#24270
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "alloys"~
say Ah, {Malloys{m.  I never bothered learning the art in great detail.
say Alloying is taking pure metals and mixing them together to make metals with different properties.
say For example, the right smithy can make a perfect block of bronze with some copper and tin.
say But I do not know where you can find these {Mother smiths{m.
say As I said before, I more or less stay out of the popular eye.
~
#24271
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "other smiths"~
say Heh? You deaf or just persistent?
say No, I haven't known any {Mother smiths{m since I left the guild decades ago.
say But if times are still like they were then, you won't have a problem finding a common smithy.
say That is, one who can refine the {Mbase metals{m.
say I'm sure there are even a handful out there who handle {Mprecious metals{m.
say Ah, but to handle the {Mmastery metals{m, now that is a rarity.
say It's just me as far as I know.
say I imagine more smiths will become known now that you have found me here.
say Perhaps my discovery will usher in a renaissance of smithing never before seen.

#24272
{gC{ca{Brn{co{gt{x SPEECH "price"~
say I will take any item, regardless of size, weight, or condition.
say And {Mrefine{m that item back to its raw metals.
say My {Mprice{m is any metals which are present in small amounts I keep.
say Any jewels or precious stones within the item I keep.
say And any excess metal over the size of a bar I also keep.
say If the metal in the item falls just short of a bar, I will make up the difference.
say So you will recieve one bar.  No more, no less.  That is my {Mprice{m.
