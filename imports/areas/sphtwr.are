 When Ao, the supreme god, created the realms known as "The Forgotten Realms"
or Feuron, a second world was also created, but ironically became the true
Forgotten Realm. The world known as The Great Realms was created, but was
nothing but a gray mass, with the only living thing being Water. The world
stayed this way, until two travelers on accident, found "The Great Rift"
which lead them into the world. The travelers, and the crew of the ship,
died. The crew died first, and the two travelers died second. When the two
travelers died, one had a pouch full of seeds on him. These seeds, combined
with the stream of water, and the decayed bodies, brought this world to life.
When Ao noticed this, he brought the two travelers back to life, and to rule
this world, as there own. These two travelers, became Nisstyre and Teron.

 The people of the world grew quickly, races and classes sprouted at rapid
speed. After 34 years of this planet living, the first cave men came into
excistence. The first settlement, known as Namlu, is where these cave men came
from. Technology grew slowly, the usual inventions where created. Fire, the
wheel, tools and clothing. Soon the cavemen became smarter, the settlement
turned into a town. Then soon, other towns came up, and the world grew...

 The first city humanity built was named Thalos, after its builder, Lord Thalos.
At this time, the world was grown pretty much as it is now. People walked
around wearing armor and clothing. Swords and diffrent weapons where created.
This city was the first, worshiping Lord Thalos, and with all its shops, was
the center point of the world.

The next one hundred years of the world would be a chaotic time.
Cities seperated by religion, and the rivers ran red with the
blood of the heretics, and the innocent.  The world decended
into a hellish place made up of smashed cities and large
armies.  Ao gave the word, and The Prophecy was put into order.
A group of three men, known as the TriPower saved the world,
but failed to stop RagNaRok.  RagNaRok struck the southern
corners of the world, and the final three years of life on this
planet were spent in darkness.
{x
It was known that most of the chaos was caused by the splitting
of all the religions.  Religion fanatics killed anyone who did
not follow their lord.

 The world grew to its point around the year 200. Many more cities and towns
where built, and soon, The Great Realms was begining to be noticed by other
gods.  The Prince Of Lies, Cyric, noticed this world. With another god, Talos,
they marched Feuron troups onto the plans of the Great Realms, hoping to take
over the world. The War Of "The Great Power Struggle" began, a fight between

 - The GUILD Treaty -
 The war has ended, but the battle has not been won. All armies are to create a

cities are to be burned, no innocent lives taken, only clan vs clan.
{x
- The Great Rift Treaty -
 No Army or Large group of creatures, are to move between the worlds. If this
treaty is broken, the world that marched its troups into the other world, will
pay a high price.

 These treaties where signed, allowing the war to continue, and the protection
that another war will not happen like this.

The year of 1265 was a major year for the Great Realms. The year was quiet
until about the summer season, when a new government was formed. This
government was known as The TriPower, lead by Nisstyre Bloodstoner, the god
of Nightmares. The First Reich of the TriPower was using the technique of
striking fear into people, to get there support. The first makou reactor was
created, and then the first makou cannon (200mm). This cannon was used to
punish the people and innocent. But soon, the people revolted, and the
TriPower fell.
{x
{x
A new TriPower was formed, once again lead by Nisstyre Bloodstoner, but this
time the god of Nightmares, stepped down from being a true God, and became
somewhat mortal. Nisstyre still has his god powers, but does not create
nightmares anymore. The second Reich of the TriPower was to protect the
people. The sudden change of the TriPower shocked people, but President
Bloodstoner claimed books where found near a portal, which had collapsed.
{x
{x
The books told about a government, which did the same thing, but fell to a
terrorist group. Soon The TriPower looked up at its new problem. RagNaRok.
A new capital city was being built, known as Torregiano. Within the city,
a cannon, about half the size of the cannon was created, dubbed "Stalin's
Organ". This cannon, when finish would vaporize Ragnarok. The first Makou
Reactor was built, creating the energy of the world into a gas form.
This gas proived heat, light, and fire power to the cannon.
{x
{x
 Also a new person showed up in the world, a person with a dark auro around
him, known as Sephiroth. He claimed he walked to this world to see it destroyed,
and to take the souls of the innocent.
{x
{x
 Also in this year, mutations showed up, attacking Westbridge, known as
Ragnarokers. Many battles where fought, and the city was kept safe.

 The year ended with a big compition known as WaterStock. After that, the
world continued on its way. The TriPower created a new invention, known as the
{x
{x
 Airship, which was a regular sailing ship suspended from a blimp, filled with
Light Makou Gas. These ships provided air transportation to everyone.
{x
{x
 A vigilanty group known as The Rejected beging to snoop around. Lead by Julius
Bloodstoner, Nisstyre Bloodstoner's son, they made sure that everyone knew they
hated the TriPower, and wanted to see the world ruled by its own people, as it
was once before. They bombed the Market Square of Westbridge, and claimed full
responsiblity for it. Soon Sephiroth showed up, causing more trouble. In the
end, Heretic Bloodstoner, Nisstyre Bloodstoner's father was killed by Sephiroth,
and Entreri Bloodstoner, Nisstyre's son, was injured. Julius Bloodstoner, showed
up, a had the cannon fire at Sephiroth, which was thought to kill him.
{x
{x
 Another Government makes its presense known, The Empire Of Vector, better known
as The Empire. This empire was lead by Ganon Vector, a bloodline leader.
 After an inventation went out to Entreri Bloodstoner, the first sign of
trouble showed up. Ganon, claimed Entreri to be a spy, and captured him, and
sentence him to death. In a battle of Hathorne Judge, the highest ranking
officer of The Legion, the TriPower Defense, Entreri Bloodstoner was
resqued, by Hathorne and a group of Heros. During the resque Hathorne
encountered Sephiroth, in which the Makou Cannon was aimed at Sephiroth,
and fired. Sephiroth disappeared after this, and Entreri was resqued.
{x
{x
 But soon a toll came on the TriPower, the Makou Cannon, had fallen onto the
almost complete capital city of Torregiano, which put schedules back a long
ways.
{x
{x
 A war was started with Vector, over this matter. The people where torn apart,
taking sides, and fighting battles. Many diffrent things happened. First Ganon
wanted to play games, stealing Westbridge's Prizes statue of Nisstyre
Bloodstoner, which was soon recovered. During this recovery, a new machine
was brought out by The Empire. Known as the war machine, a large scorpion
stood over everyone, but was soon killed. The war stepped into a new era.
Ganon soon sent his head General, Ghastil, into Titan Valley. Titan Valley
was taken over by Vector, and held. Zozo was next on the list.
{x
{x
 Kefka soon showed up, Ganon's advisory, and second to the
throne. He walked around Westbridge watching the people, and planning. He
always expressed a disliking to Ganon. He always claimed his love for his
people, who suffered from the war. Soon, Kefka, paying Sephiroth of all
people, to kill Ganon. Ganon was killed, and Kefka came into power, ending
the war, making peace with the TriPower, and giving the Titan Valley back
to its people.
{x
{x
 Soon after the world went back to its old self, but not for long. Soon,
another group came up, the mayor of the small village of Hilp, begin claiming
lands, like Mahn'Tor, which was soon returned to them. Titan Valley was taken
over by Shadan, and then Shadan crossed the world and took over Myth Drannor.
{x
{x
 Soon the group known as "The Knights Of Myth Drannor" came into power of
these lands. They lost the Titan Valley, to Trip, of the clan of Strife. The
TriPower does not wish to help any group, Vector is very quiet, and the
world seems oddly enough, too quiet. Something big is on the horizon, but
no one knowns.....

Makou energy can be harnessed with the use of magical rods.  These
rods, enchanted with varies spells, will attract mako energy.  These
rods are placed in the reactor core of a Class A Makou Reactor.  The
rods attract the energy, gather it and sends it to the compression
chamber, through iron rods, wrapped into each other.  Steam from the
steam engines in the reactor compress the energy in the chamber which
is thrown between two iron rods, will cause a chemical reaction and
creature diffrent forms of mako.  Diffrent pressures will give
diffrent results, but depends on the reactor type.  Class A reactors
produce Makou Gas, which after compressed in the chambers, is pumped
out to storage tanks, and into your homes.  Most reactors are started
by coal for the steam engine, but after makou gas is produced, it
creates the fire for the steam engine.

Energy can even be seen in a solid form, known as Materia.  Materia is
found usually around mountains, where mako energy is strong.  As Mako
Fountains are, those fountains being the focal point of the Mako
Energy.  WARNING: High exposure to the lifestream or raw Mako Energy

{cBefore you stands a mighty and virtually imopenetrable stone wall. 
The wall stands 50 feet high, the product of a hundred years of hard
labour by dwarven slaves.  Majestically framing the {8tower{c, letting
visitors and dignitaries gain entrance by the gate.  Here, the sky
remains a steely grey colour, never changing no matter what time of
day it is.  The {Bi{Ccy{c haze slinks steathily around you, causing your
eyes to sting and {Bi{Cce{c slightly.  Here you can try your hand at coaxing
the iron gates pen, so you can investigate the looming {8tower{c within
the walls or you can turn back to the {Cr{Boad{c that heads northward.

deep redwood, and all are bookshelves.  The library is filled with all
kinds of weird things.  Many reading tables, a few globes, maps and
old furniture.  Candles light the room.  To the south is the throne
and reading area, all around is the massive library of the Great

The throne of Sephiroth himself stands before you.  The cold stone
throne stands on a raise platform, shaped as a circle.  The throne
stands cut from the cold rock that makes up the area around Mahn'Tor,
the craftsmenship of the throne looks nice, as fine cut patterns edge
off the throne.  The raised platform is encrusted with jewels on the
top.  Black jewels make up most of the surface, except for fine
crafted red jewels that create a pentagram.  In front of the throne to
the south is a sitting area, made up of couches and chairs.  In the
center a large table stands, with a good amount of books on it.  All
around you is the vast library.

large glass window overlooks the southern end of the tower, off into
the snowy wasteland of Mahn'Tor.  The library stands in all
directions.  A plaque has been bolted to the floor.

{cAn {Gemerald {ggreen {ccarpet of grass spreads out here, perfectly
manicured.  In various spots of the courtyard, there are shocks of {rred
{cand {wwhite{c, which upon closer examination, turn out to be rose bushes. 
A sultry breeze sweeps through gently, bringing with it the scent of
flowers, and oddly lightning.  Up ahead is an ornately carved
fountain, trickling with seven small streams of water.  {x

You stand in a quiet part of the labratory.  This room isn't as
bright as the other rooms, only a soft glow from the candles in the
room.  A healer sits in the corner, working on some new spells. 
Furinture is spread across the entire room.  Back east is the lab.
