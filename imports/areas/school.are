Welcome to combat training.

The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
easily.

The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'NORTH' from
here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
escape from him.

You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.

After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
to the next station, go 'WEST'.

Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
types.  Kill them all!

After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
to wear your newly won equipment.

When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
God will reward you for this.

Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
surroundings.

~
{x
You have reached the final spot for learning about the world as it
pertains to YOUR character.  Last but not least, you need to know 
what to do when things go wrong.
{x
The first recourse is to use the ask/answer channel to ask your fellow
players for help.  Many times, friendly and experienced players will
come to your aid if only you ask.  The syntax for using the ask/answer
channel is simply: {Yask I just got blinded.  How to I fix it?{x or 
whatever question you have.  Courtesy is always to thank your fellow
players by typing: {Yanswer Thank you!{x  
{x
If there are more pressing issues that players cannot answer or haven't
answered, you can look for your friendly neighborhood Mortal Admin (MA).
These are people who have chosen to dedicate their time to helping when
people ask it of them.  You can find your MA by typing: {Ywho MA{w or
by typing {Ywho {wand looking for the player with the purple {MM{x by
their name.  You can talk to them by typing: {Ytell <name> Could you{x
{Yplease help me get my corpse?{x  Or whatever question you may have.
{x
Lastly, you can request immortals to help.  This should definitely be a
last resort.  You can reach immortals by typing: {Ypray <question>{x.  Do
understand that this method does not guarantee you an answer right away,
as immortals are busy and sometimes idle.  Do NOT spam them.  If your
pray is not immediately answered, you may always write a note to the
immortals.
{x
If you are ready to move to the next level of your learning, please say:

You have graduated from Mud School!  Take your diploma...if you can.
Go 'NORTH' from here to visit our arena.  There are plenty of low-level
monsters, but DON'T attack other players.

If you want to go directly back to the temple at any time, type 'RECALL'.

If you need more help during the game, type 'HELP'.  If you see something
wrong or have comments, use 'BUG', 'IDEA', or 'TYPO' to report them.

May your visit here be ... mercenary.

{MI{mnteracting {MW{mith {MO{mthers: {CNote Board{x~
~
{x
The note board is important for keeping up with what is going
on in the realm.  For this lesson, there will be no teacher.
{x
If you type {Munread {wyou will get a list of the messages
available for you to read.  If you see a bright yellow line,
which you will likely see all of them in bright yellow for now,
it means you have unread notes.
{x
To read a certain type of note, simply type the name of the
type of note.  For instance, if you type: {Mnews {wyou will see
the first news note from your unread news list.
{x
If you do not wish to read certain types of notes, forums, for
instance, you can type: {Mforum catch{w.  This will make all the
forum note show up as read.  If you do not wish to read any
old notes, type: {Mcatch all{w.
{x
Catch all will NOT catch you up on news notes, as these are
immortal announcements.
{x
The only notes you as a mortal cannot write are:
news, changes, penalty, rolenews, and weddings.
Those are the domain of immortals only.
{x
Lastly, in order to keep trolls from spewing, you cannot
post notes until you are level 15.

~
{x
{x
Here you will learn about summons and summoning.  Due to the
quick nature of this topic, you will not have a teacher here.
{x
Summon is a spell that allows a player to bring other players
or mobs to themselves.  There are, however, limitations to this
spell in order to be summoned.
{x
1) You must have the other player friended.  ({Mfriend <player>{w)
2) You must be in a NON-safe room.
3) You must have config summon off ({Mconfig summon{w)
{x
Once these three things are satisfied, you can be summoned for
whatever reason.  Word to the wise:  {mDo not pester players for
{mrides.{w  Players with summon capabilities are not a ferrying
service.

{x
First - mobs can cast spells on you such as blindness,
and they can also poison you.  These can be cured at any
healer.
{x
They may also cast spells against you that cause damage, 
such as meteor swarm, gas breath, and so on.  These types
of spells can have their damage greatly reduced by having
sanctuary cast upon you.  As Ribald taught you, sanctuary
halves damage.  It is a vital shield.
{x
Shields can be gained at certain temples and from certain
mobs.  You will learn more about this later.

Looting and sacrificing are what you do at the end of
every battle where you kill a mob.  Looting is when you
take everything from the corpse of a mob - most often 
money.  Sacrificing is when you destroy the corpse by 
offering it to the gods.
{x
You can turn looting and sacrificing on and off by
typing: {Yconfig loot{w and/or {Yconfig sacrifice{w.  This
might be necessary in cases where you are using the

{x
Waterdeep has a wonderful quest system where you can obtain a quest
in exchange for quest points which can be used to buy - well - a lot!
{x
In general, it is recommended that you hero your second tier character
before questing simply because quest points do NOT roll over when you
reroll.
{x
There are simple quests given by shopkeeps, area quests given by Quija,
the questmaster, as well as Immortal Quests which are done at the whim
of the immortals.

Arena is a way you can challenge other players to a "duel" to

not allow looting.
{x
Using arena you can either fight other players, or even bet on
those who are fighting.  If you type: {Yhelp arena{w it will show
you the different commands.  For a short list, just type {Yarena{x.
{x
From time to time there are also mass arena events, or wars, where
multiple people can join at one time.  As with many things, you 
can toggle whether or not you see arena challenges, and whether
or not you can be challenged yourself.

{x
Hero Runs are what many people choose to do once they reach
second tier hero level.  There are many different runs which
require different sized groups to complete.  Loot from the
runs are then lotto'd to the group members in the interest of
fairness.
{x
If you type: {Yclaimed{w you can see the list of available
runs and whether or not they are open, completed, or closed.
{x
Keep in mind, first tier heroes are generally NOT invited on 
these runs since they lack the hero level skills required to
beat the challenges necessary to finish the run.
{x
Winning the loot is good for equipping your own characters
with nice items, and can always be auctioned off to other
players looking to buy.

Roleplaying on Waterdeep is NOT enforced, but it IS encouraged.
There are two basic sides to the roleplay world of Waterdeep.
First is the global roleplay, which is what is going on in the
greater world.  Second is the individual roleplay which is 
conducted by the individual players and may or may not have an
impact on the global roleplay situations.
{x

If you are unfamiliar with or nervous about roleplay and would
like guidance, type {Ywho rpt{w.  This will show you the players
who have dedicated their time to teach roleplaying to those who
wish to learn.

To see what is going on in the realms, you may also read roleplay
notes (as well as rolenews notes).  You may also write your own!

beside the line for exits, there is one that says "Doors."  South
is obviously the way you came, but east is somewhere new.  The
difference is that if you try to type in east and go there right
now, you won't be able to!  Try it.  {YType: east{w, then {Yhit enter{x.
