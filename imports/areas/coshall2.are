{8You enter a d{7ar{&ke{7ne{8d, foul smelling Chamber.  Massive blocks of
{7G{8ran{7i{&t{7e {8secure the room to an almost incarcerated sort of feeling. 
Thick, luminous {gm{yo{gss {8grows rampant in the southern corner of the
room...  Upon closer investigation one would only find {1r{8ot{1t{8ing corpses
buried beneath the soothing mass.  Large claw marks deny the ability
of being ignored with their over abundance upon the walls, slivers of
s{7pl{&i{7n{1t{8ere{1d{8 bone still protrude as evidence of many victims falling to
{5I{8n{%s{5a{8n{7i{5ty{8 within its confines.  Several instruments of {1T{8o{7r{&t{1u{&r{7e{8 surround
the pious desk centered within the room.
