Everything tends to look the same in this city, this avenue running

that's due to the haste this city was built with.  This land was once
a large field west of the Fortress of Vector, Soldiers of the old
Vectorian Army would have trained now where residents sleep.  New

A Avenue is the second most northern street in the city, running
east to west from the city wall in the west to the Magitek Factory's
northern gate to the east.  Large homes line either side of this
residential street, trees line the street itself.  Most know the north
end as the upper class of the city, hidden behind trees and grass, far
away from the smoke stacks of the industrial sector.

Everything tends to look the same in this city, this avenue running
east to west looks just like the streets running north and south.  But
that's due to the haste this city was built with.  This land was once
a large field west of the Fortress of Vector, Soldiers of the old
Vectorian Army would have trained now where residents sleep.  New
bricks and recycled material from the fortress went in creating this
area.

The north side of New Vector City is seen as somewhat upper class
or even rich compared to some of the dwellings in this new city.  This
is mainly due to the north end being far away from the smoke stacks of
the industrial sectors.  Only when the wind blows right does it bring
the black smoke towards these people.

Running through the western heart of the city is C Street, either
side of its brick street are brick buildings and homes, shops and
saloons.  Commerical businesses are kept on the streets while Avenues
and Boulevards are more residential.  Despite the great haste behind
the construction of the city, a well constructed plan might have been
used.

Modest homes of the working class people line either side of C
Street, along with shops and other 'commerical' buildings.  People
walk the street making their way city block to city block, moving to
shops and other places of business and other people's homes.  The new
city was built in haste, recycled and new materials and the same plans
repeated over and over, giving the city a cookie cutter style of
construction.

Like most of the streets, avenues and boulevards of New Vector
City, this street resembles everything else.  The haste of the city
construction caused everything to seem the same, not helping was the
generic street names.  C Street here might look like A Street.  Only
the slight differences in the buildings and homes allow people to
navigate the city without getting lost.

This avenue runs west to east along the southern end of New Vector
City and unlike its older brother A Avenue on the north end, the more
poorer citizens of the city live in these neighborhoods.  Far east at
the end of the south end is the Vectorian Industrial Sector, its large
smoke stacks standing tall and casting a shadow over these homes at
night.

The southern end of New Vector City is home to the larger worker
class families who dwell in the industrial sectors of Vector.  Many of
them work in the industrial sector just east of their neighborhood,
while others work in the Magitek Factory.  Some even take the train
and work in St.  Plattsgbugh.

Everything tends to look the same in this city, this avenue running
east to west looks just like the streets running north and south.  But
that's due to the haste this city was built with.  This land was once
a large field west of the Fortress of Vector, Soldiers of the old
Vectorian Army would have trained now where residents sleep.  New
bricks and recycled material from the fortress went in creating this
area.

The north side of New Vector City is seen as somewhat upper class
or even rich compared to some of the dwellings in this new city.  This
is mainly due to the north end being far away from the smoke stacks of
the industrial sectors.  Only when the wind blows right does it bring
the black smoke towards these people.

Everything tends to look the same in this city, this avenue running
east to west looks just like the streets running north and south.  But
that's due to the haste this city was built with.  This land was once
a large field west of the Fortress of Vector, Soldiers of the old
Vectorian Army would have trained now where residents sleep.  New
bricks and recycled material from the fortress went in creating this
area.

A large stone square appears, named after the current Emperor of
Vector and the first newly   {M--    --{x  constructed item at the Fortress
since its own deconstruction {M||   //{x  and the end of War between itself
and the Tripower Kingdom.    {M||  //{x  Beyond this square lies what is
known as New Vector City,    {M|| //{x  built from the remains of the old
fortress and recycled iron   {M||//{x  from soldiers armor and old magitek
machinery.  Southwards lies  {M||\\{x  Castle Drive which leads to the old
Vectorian Castle, home of    {M|| \\{x  the Emperor.  Which was once a field
is now an industrial zone,   {M||  \\{x  and Workers Dormitories, the life
blood of the new city.       {M||   \\{x  North leads down A Street, one of
many new cookie cutter       {M--    --{x  streets built in this new city.
Eastwards the brick street of Main Street passes between two large brick
walls and beyond that, Old Vector City.  Westwards the street continues
to the center of New Vector City.
