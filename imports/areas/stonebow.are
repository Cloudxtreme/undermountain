You are standing in a fragrant, sunny room surrounded by dried
herbs, fresh-cut and potted flowers, and plants.  Sprigs of herbs hang
from the stucco walls, tied with twine or ribbon; pots of herbal
extracts and medicines line the wall behind the long marble counter in
the back corner.  A large skylight opening allows sunlight to stream
across the leafy, lush green plants.  Small stands and carts are
arranged throughout.  Large bouquets of fresh-cut flowers and garlands
festoon the marble counter, ready to be purchased for the last-minute
wedding...  Or a quick romantic evening.  A stone door is located to
the west, and south leads back out onto the street.

Abandoned, unkempt courtyard~
~
Scraggly weeds lie forlornly tangled at about knee-height.  Ivy
clings desperately to the cobbles of the surrounding buildings, and
creeps upward toward the eaves.  A huge tree with faded, papery silver
bark grows in the center of the courtyard, its branches spreading
parallel to the ground, and reaching up much farther than the eyes can
see.  Small, dull gold-brown leaves seem to cling for dear life to the
tree, and appear to be long dead.  There is an exit to the east into
an alley, and another south, also into an alley, probably the same one
in fact.  To the west is a doorway into a building, and another
smaller doorway is north.

Caterer's shop~
~
This small shop is sparsely decorated, save for a long glass counter and
a few chairs.  There are a few engravings of various food items carved
into the wooden walls on each side.  A delightful aroma of roasting meat
and fresh baked goods wafts from the back of the shop.

Erasmus' Mystical Oils and Potions~
~
This moderately-lit, aromatic shop is totally disorganized....vials,
flasks, jars, canisters, and tubes of all shapes and sizes seem to be
cast about the shop haphazardly.  Despite the disarray, the place has
a cheery feel; the scent of orange peel and rose hips, cinnamon and
cloves, bergamot, jasmine, berries, and cedar and sandalwood intermingle
and seem to seep into your senses.  In the middle of the store is a
narrow granite counter, almost hidden by potions, petals, and powders.
In the center of it is a large mortar and pestle, and a burner upon
which some mysterious but arousing liquid bubbles and foams.

~
A well-lighted, dazzlingly bright shop.  Shelves line each wall, and
are loaded with neatly-folded, crisply-pressed sheets, pillowcases, and

varying from pristine, brilliant white to deepest midnight blue.
Finger towels, hand towels, and washcloths are stacked neatly on the

Overgrown Room~
~
Outcast plants seem to congregate here.  They grow out of the floorboard,
out of the walls, and down from the ceiling.  In fact, they seem to walk
in unaccompanied and sit in the corner.  Go figure.  There is a fern in
the corner.  Ivy dribbles down the south wall.  A lack of oxygen makes
it difficult to breathe.

We Be Weddings~
~
This wooden-plank lined room is....unimpressive at best.  Black and
pink checkered curtains hang limply from the windows.  A single,
tattered brown streamer is tiredly tacked to the front of the plywood
podium.  A gilded-frame picture of the Almighty Elvis hangs lopsidedly
next to an old photo labeled "Forrest Gump".  Near the ramshackle podium
is an old willow rocker, in which slumps perhaps the OLDEST creature
living...you know it's alive, as a thin trickle of smoke dribbles lazily
from a drooping corncob pipe between its withered lips.  A large
sunflower is displayed prominently in front of the podium.

This foyer is rather sparse in furnishings.  There are a few iron candle

with blue and gold threads.  There is an exit to the north into the

Chapel~
~
This small, intimate chapel is more druidic than not; it is filled
with trees and leafy green plants.  Sunshine streams in through
skylights and the east wall, which is paneled in carved wooden
screens.  A small brook winds through the chapel from north to south,
and disappears under the floor to the south.  A small footbridge
divides the brook, and small fish can be seen darting about beneath
the water.  There is a carved wooden altar near the north wall; small,
comfortable benches face the altar in two columns forming a single row
from north to south.  There is a paneled door to the north out into
the courtyard gardens, south back to the church foyer, and east into
the church sanctuary.

Sanctuary~
~
This massive room is lavishly paneled in dark, rich mahogany, polished
to an unearthly glow.  Rows and rows of matching dark pews are lined
up neatly on either side of a long central aisle.  A lavishly
embroidered runner in blues, golds, and reds runs between the rows of
pews.  Four ceiling-high, elaborately-colored stained glass windows
decorate the north wall behind the main altar, and depict the four
primary gods and goddess of Thera in various poses: Vengeance, Eriana,
Felix, and Tim, as they represent the four primary directions of the map.
Deep, rolling bass organ music plays softly from a hidden source, and
seems to roll from the top of the carved wooden cathedral ceiling.
Silver candelabras holding long white tapers glow softly at the back of
the room, along the aisle, and around the altar.  There is a door to the
north, near the altar, an exit west into the chapel, one south to the
church foyer, and a stairway up into the sister-sanctuary.

~
This sanctuary is paneled in modest oak.  The benches, which form two
parallel rows running alongside a central aisle, and the wall paneling
re also oak.  Clear, multi-paned windows stretching to the ceiling allow
sunlight to flood the sanctuary with an almost holy light.  Beyond the
windows, you see the church garden and the summerhouse, in which many
weddings are performed.  There is an exit to the north, to the gazebo
and gardens; an exit east into the sister-sanctuary; an exit south into
the vestibule; and an exit west.

Main Church Gardens~
~
This expanse of lush, cool, manicured lawn runs basically
north-south.  Cool, matronly willows are scattered here, their
branches high enough to not annoy most guests.  A sanded path leads
from the south exit to the sanctuary to the gazebo at the north end. 
On either side of the path is a row of smooth, polished brown stones,
interspersed with groundflowers; violets, starflowers, dandelions, and
chrysanthemums.  There is ample room on each side of the path for
benches or chairs, used frequently for large weddings and parties. 
The large, glistening white summerhouse is to the north; beneath it
runs the east-west running brook, from which an outlet has been formed
to create a large rock garden and waterfall to the southeast of the
gazebo.  A tall hedge grows behind it, running north-south, and
obscuring a corner of the gardens.  The exits here are north to the
summerhouse, east to the gardens, south into the church foyer, and
west to more gardens.

Gazebo (summerhouse)~
~
This immaculately painted white summerhouse is a popular locale for
spring and summer weddings.  It is octagonal, with white latticework
paneling on the off-walls.  Leafy plants and dazzling flowers trail
lazily from hanging baskets anchored around the ceiling perimeter. 
Padded, comfortable white benches are arranged in two rows on either
side of the central north-south aisle.  The garden brook runs beneath
the summerhouse in an east-west direction; one arm of it bends
southward and spills into a waterfall and rock garden immediately to
the southeast.  The paneling north is butted up against a tight privet
hedge, beyond which nothing can be seen.  The only exit is south, into
the central which nothing can be seen.  Exits are in all directions,
into the many parts of the church gardens.

A Quiet Section of the Church Gardens~
~
This area is secluded and quiet.  Protected on all four sides by a
tall, thick hedge, many people are unaware that it exists.  At ground
level to the north, you can catch glimpses of the brook.  A thick
canopy of willows obscures the sky here, and the temperature is much
cooler here than in any part of the garden.  This is an excellent
place to meditate, rest, or recuperate; it seems well-protected and
hidden enough that no enemy could easily find it.  Standing watch over
this quiet section of garden is a statue of the goddess Eriana.  The
statue is fashioned from alabaster, and there is an inscription
written at her feet.  To the west is a small clearing, and to the
south lies the main church gardens.

Wine cellar~
~
This dark, cool cellar smells faintly of alcohol and rancid berries.
It is quiet and clean, and much cooler than the rest of the inn.  Large
wooden casks line the north and east walls.  Wine racks line the south
wall, and form freestanding rows to the south.  There is a small door
to the west, and the staircase leading up.

Vineyards~
~
This part of the vineyard is surrounded on the north, south, and west
sides by a tall, impenetrable hedge.  Long, staked rows of grapevines
grow in twisted lines here.  Each row is separated by roughly five feet
of turf.  Rich, sweet clusters of varied grapes...concord, flamereds,
Billings, Marcuses, Schwemps, and Heinekens cling ponderously from the
vines.  Bees dance lazily around the clusters, and the air is redolent
with the scent of dew-washed fruit.  The exits are north to the street,
south to the orchard and west to the rest of the vinyards.

snort, grunt, bark, purr, trill and hoot in a bizarre cacophony.  Most
of the pets are kept elsewhere; this is, after all, a special order
shop for LARGE breeds as well as small.  There is a sign tacked to the

somewhere nearby, as the birds sing praise from high in the trees and
atop the eaves of the many thatched roofs.  To the west is a large
building with a sign that says "Welcome to Stonebow Dale" hanging from
the side facing north.  A tall spire suggests it might be a church of
some king.  The city walls run east and west starting here, and this
avenue continues south.  A small footpath intersects here east and

Crystal Square~
~
Located at the intersection of Redfern Road and DragonCove, this square
is rather small in contrast to its northern counterpart.  Instead of a
fountain, here is situated an obsidian pedestal, upon which is balanced
a huge blue crystal.  It appears that nothing holds the crystal in place;
yet it balances perfectly on one pointed tip.  Redfern Road runs east and
west of here; DragonCove Road runs north and south.  There is a signpost
here.

blue crystal~
This crystal is a complete mystery; it stands about eight feet tall,
and is made of some completely clear crystal of unknown origin or
purpose.  Roughly marquis-shaped, it balances on one point, its other
pointed skyward.  Lights dance within the depths of the glass, bursting
into a myriad of colors deep within, and radiate outward, causing the
crystal to appear surrounded by some mystical aura It hums faintly.

Atop the Carriage House~
~
{C
 You stand precariously atop the roof of a carriage house in
Stonebow Dale.  A light breeze blows as children playing can
be heard not too far off in the distance. The sound of horse
hooves against cobblestone resound nearby. You peer over the
eave of the house.  It is much too steep to safely drop down,
but then there is a sun window at the other end that remains
propped open to allow the cooling breeze inside. It looks to
be just big enough to squeeze through while underneath there
are soft bails of hay to break your fall.  Perhaps this will
be the way out.  A decorated man stands here, looking at you.{x

On Top of the Gazebo~
~
You somehow manage to climb atop the quaint gazebo, affording you a
view across the gardens and the northeast part of Stonebow Dale.  To
the east across the street, you can make out the large church. 
Standing well above its high stone walls, you see a strange sight
within: several young ladies are sitting within the hidden courtyard,
wearing nothing but their distinctive black and white headdresses. 
They are laughing and carrying about in seemingly forbidden acts that
would make ever a streeter blush.  You wonder what else there is to
see up here.
