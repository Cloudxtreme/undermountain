Dirt Path~
~
This hard, rocky path is made up of dirt and clay.  It seems as if
it has tried to hide from sight for the many years of its existence. 
Various plants and bushes have grown across the entire path, creating
obstacles for those who traverse it.  The path continues to the
south, while a road lies to the west.

Dirt Path~

What looks to be over a hundred rocks and pebbles have found their
resting spot on this part of the dirt path.  The plants and bushes
have seemed to cease growing for a bit.  A wonderful view of the sky
can be seen above, not hidden by trees or plants like usual.  The path
seems to get much greener back to the north, while it appears to stay
the same to the south.

The dirt path takes a quick turn to the west at this point. 
Various types of rocks and stones have rested here for a long time. 
The dirt here has recently been travelled through, as one can see the
many footprints and tracks left by some unknown group.  A bit of the
bushes and plants have also been trampled, bent, or broken.  The path
looks about the same to the north, while there is a curve leading to
the west.

The path recovers from an abrupt turn to the west.  Leaves from the
trees high above have fallen to their dying spot here on the dirt
path.  The crushed leaves crackle in the wind.  A well-sized branch
has also broken off to sit on the ground.  It is slightly covered in
dirt that has blown over it recently.  The path continues to the east
and west, with some sort of noise rising from the west.

Large trees rise up from the ground on each side of the path,
blocking off exits to the north and south.  These trees seem to flourish
as they look completely healthy and fresh.  A little sapling appears
to have just began its growth in the center of the path.  A small
mound of soil has developed around it, giving the sapling the
appropriate nutrients to grow.  The sky above is blocked off by the
many branches and treetops that lie above.  The path continues east and
west, with a strange noise of rushing coming from the west.

and others make up this path.  Various colors also rest here,
including red, brown, and black.  Cracked mud rests on one side of the
path, obviously dried out from sitting in the sun all day.  Shadows
are created from some of the trees that stand tall above the path on
either side.  These shadows rest on the ground and make a soft portion
of dirt in certain parts.  The path also makes a swift
turn to the north here, while it stays straight to the east.

The dirt path comes to another curve.  The sound that has been
getting louder seems to be just a little to the west.  The amount of
trees seems to increase greatly to the west as it appears as though
there is a forest just across from here.  The light brown branches
overhead also increase a bit here, preparing for the immense trees
that are to be found in the forest to the west.  The dirt path
continues to the south, leading back to the beginning, but comes to an
end to the west as it turns into a strange-looking forest.

Beginning of a Forest~
~
The dirt path to the east comes to a cease as many trees rise up
out of almost nowhere.  These trees are incredibly tall and there is a
great number of them.  Each tree seems to get higher and higher in
what almost appears to be a pattern.  The forest is completely dark
and seems to be somewhat mystical and haunting.  An occasional cry of
a bird can be heard echoing throughout the trees and branches. 
Without a light, the ground cannot be seen below the traveller.  The
forest continues in all directions, excluding east which leads to a
dirt path.

A Forest~
~
This part of the forest is surrounded by trees that overwhelm those
who travel through this area.  The sky above can barely be seen due to
the thick branches that have grown above.  The ground itself is made
up of straw that has fallen from the trees and dirt.  There is a very
gloomy darkness that rests over this forest.  The forest continues to
the south and west.

The southern part of the forest comes to a hault as the trees start
to grow closer and closer.  The tightness created from this leaves
little room for sunlight during the day.  The towering trees also
suffer from the growth of moss on their trunks and branches.  The
sticky mass of moss seems to ooze from the trees, barely hanging from
the trunks.  Soil has become very soft and squishy here, as well.  A
very dark place, this section of the forest seems somewhat eerie and
spooky.

Many of the roots here have came up out of the ground to cause a
somewhat difficult path to cross.  A small patch of flowers sits in
the middle of this puzzle of roots.  These flowers stand out greatly
as they are the only source of color in the sea of blandness that
takes over this forest.  Aside from the little batch of flowers
resting peacefully in the middle, this section of the forest seems
very similar to any other parts.  There is a brightness that seems to
glow coming from the west, though.

Many of the trees above have began to sway just a bit for some odd
reason.  Small strips of bark are located on the ground, some crunched
and ripped from those who have walked through this forest lately.  A
small group of bushes has begun to grow next to a large tree.  These
bushes look like a small group of kids in the middle of a grown up
forest of flourishing trees and brush.  The forest continues to the
east, west, and south.

Small plants and rock are much more common in this part of the
forest than the large, bulky trees that make up most of the woods. 
Almost jungle-like, the shrubs and weeds that grow here are larger
than average.  A variety of colors is created from the many flowers
that grow up out of the ground.  These flowers can barely be seen due
to the much larger and heavier apperance of the grass and plants.

The forest becomes much lighter than usual here, apparently due to
the large valley to the west.  The slope downwards begins just a
little to the west.  The density of the trees seems to thin out a lot
compared to the rest of the forest.  Small cracks of light have
apparently found their way to the ground during the day.  This is
noticable by the hardness of the soil in certain parts of the forest. 
An assortment of rocks sits to one side of the forest, a bit scattered
by some sort of animal or person that has recently been this way.

The density increases a bit to the west, putting a hault to the
passage that was once here.  Some vines have begun to grow here,
hanging down from the treetops above.  Aside from the trees that block
off the west and north, there is a lack of plantlife here.  The sky
can be seen quite clearly, which is unusual in this forest.  Just a
bit to the southwest, one can see a valley that begins.  It slopes
down into some unknown place.

these towering trees cracks and falls off to the ground.

Hillside~

A slight slope downwards starts to form here.  Tiny blades of grass
have grown on the hillside, setting the mood for what actually appears
to be a peaceful valley.  This is a big difference from the forest
that lies to the east.  Various stones form a strange, uncontrolled
path down to the bottom of this valley.  This area appears to be the
'calm before the storm', as something strange definately lies below. 
Back to the east, one can find the spooky forest that seems to be much
darker than unusual.

The valley causes one to adjust to the difficult trail to traverse.
It gets a bit steeper in certain parts, but stays calm and refrains
from any sudden dropoffs.  Branches have found their way over to this
treeless valley from the dark forest to the east.  The valley seems to
get deeper and deeper right now, although it is somewhat close to the
bottom.  A strange smell has begun to rest in this part of the valley,
probably rising from that which lies below.  Sounds of the forest come
from above while almost complete silence lies below.

Rocks and mud make up this side of the hill leading into the valley
below.  The stones and pebbles have begun to get a bit loose due to
the multitude of travellers who go down this way.  The absence of
trees gives way to the intense sunlight during the day and a view of
the glowing moon at night.  Blankets of insects can usually be found
here, fluttering about in the tall grass that grows here.  Looking
over the cliff, one can see the valley that lies below in the center. 
Straight across from here lies another hill going back up in the
distance.

Overlooking the Valley~
~
The continous slope fails to come to a stop as it begins to get
steeper than usual.  There is an extreme absence of plantlife here on
the hill and down in the valley.  The bottom of the valley can almost
be seen clearly, but there is just a bit of fog that stands in the
way.  A strange sound emanates from below, creating a sense of caution
to those who approach.  Back up this side of the hill, a forest can be
seen as the trees that occupy it swing just a bit in the soft wind
that fills the entire area.  Little groups of minute plants are found
scattered about this slope, assisting the bare appearance of the
landscape.

Soft spots of dirt have crumbled into millions of even smaller
pieces to give a sense of danger.  One must watch every step on the
way down.  Three mushrooms have found some way to live in this area. 
The various colors of the mushrooms is something hard to find in this
bland, boring place of monotonous colors.  Purple spots on one
mushroom stand out very clearly compared to the background of the rest
of the hill.  The height and thickness of the grass has decreased
slightly, looking to start a pattern for the rest of the way down.

Cliff~
~
The once heavy fog seems to clear a great deal as it gives way to
the magnificent view of a strange city at the bottom of the valley. 
The city is completely different from any other place of living. 
Caves and large rocks make up stores and homes.  No occupants can be
seen, though.  The ground of the dwellings is made of the same dirt
that can be found here.  The land surrounding the city of astonishment
is barren and desolate in its presence.  Terribly abused twigs and
branches rest on the ground, obviously mistreated by the various
creatures that have journeyed up and down the hillside going to and
from the village below.

Hillside~

The slope is very steep here as it approaches the very bottom of
the valley.  The hillside is constructed of the same monotonous bits
of rocks and dirt.  The dirt is a soft brown color that is spread out
in a very thin manner, as if it was done by someone on purpose.  Some
of the small animals that inhabit the forest above have left markings
that show their complete inability to walk down this steep part of the
hill, scratching and pawing to keep balance.  Broken twigs also serve
notice for this.  Back upwards, some of the larger trees in the forest
can be seen standing far above while the bottom of the valley is
extremely close.

Bottom of the Hill~
~
The large hill comes to a sudden halt as the flat land comes in for
a change.  Instead of a bumpy slope that is quite difficult to walk,
the ground is finally flat and unchanging.  The once small grass has
become just a bit thicker and taller than before.  Just a bit to the
west lies a city composed of large boulders with caves carved into
them.  What or who lives in the city is unknown at this point. 
Whether or not one should use caution remains to be seen.

Approaching the City~
~
The compact city lies just a bit more to the west.  The path
travelled here lies behind, a large cliff with a silent forest resting
atop it.  Buzzing sounds of business and bustling activity emanate
from the city, becoming larger with each step towards it.  What lies
inside the city still remains to be seen, as the entrance is
completely blocked by two humongous boulders on each side.  The
entrance to the west is nothing more than a hole in the middle of
these gigantic stones.  Looking closer, some sort of ooze can be
noticed slowly trickling from the top of each boulder to find its way
to the ground beside them.

Entrance to the City~
~
Two enormous masses of rock sit boldly on each side of the
entrance.  An awful smell seems to pour out of each one, but upon
further inspection it can be concluded that this terrible odor is
caused by some sort of gunk that dribbles from minute cracks and
crevices in the stones.  The entrance itself is nothing more than a
barely passable opening in the center of these blockages.  It is made
entirely of the same dirt that is found on the hill to the east. 
Those who are brave enough and enjoy adventure will have little
trouble passing through here, even though it is a place of complete
mystery and bewilderment.

City of the Creepers~
~
The small living area is home to a race called the creepers.  These
creatures live inside slimy caves and give off some strange sort of
ooze at times.  The entire town is surrounded by huge boulders and
rocks.  Inside the rocks lies even more stones that have caves carved
into them.  These caves serve as the shops, businesses, or living
quarters for families of creepers.  The city is actually much more
awake than it appeared to be from a distance, with many sounds coming
from all sorts of directions.  The very tops of the rocks serve as a
means to block certain weather.  Daylight is almost consumed by
shadows given off by these incredibly-sized stones.  One can leave the
City of the Creepers to the east, while all other directions lead into
the very active city.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This is the very first home built here in the city.  It is actually
a large cave, as opposed to a brick or stone building.  The walls of
the home are made up of red dirt and clay.  There are places along the
sides of the cave where the clay has hardened too much and begun to
crumble a bit.  These crumbling walls form small piles of clay on the
floor, mixing into the dirt ground.  The entrance to the home is very
interesting, too.  A single piece of fabric has been placed hanging
down over the entrance/exit.  There are no doors to be found, just the
fabric.  There are a couple of holes cut into the cloth, allowing
sunlight to shine through during the day.  The cave overall is a very
compact, cozy-looking place.  There is a workbench of some sort on one
side across from a very small table.  Two cots are also placed in the
center of the dwelling.  There must be two Creepers that live here. 
The cots looks very used and worn out, and they would probably be
quite difficult to actually rest or sleep in.  The city of the
Creepers can be found back to the east, where the fabric hangs over
the entrance.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
This road in the city continues to run north and south along the
town.  To the east stands a huge wall that blocks off enemy invaders
who would look to attack the Creepers.  The path is actually made up
of dirt and rocks, and it looks quite unstable and tough on the feet
of those travellers who have come here unprepared.  Bits of rubble
have been broken up and form jagged edges that look extremely sharp
and pointed.  There are a couple of sticks that have been either
forgotten or left on purpose.  They are each leaning on the large,
protective wall.  The road continues to the north and south.  Looking
out west will make an entire city visible.  All sorts of shops,
stores, homes, businesses, and other buildings can be seen throughout
the city.  Each place looks to be a cave of some sort.  One would
probably come to the quick conclusion that this particular city is one
of the strangest cities in the Realms.

This part of the city branches off to form a street constructed of
various stones and rocks scattered in the ground.  Jagged edges of
rocks jut up from the ground at certain points, but the majority of
the ground is flat and safe.  Sounds of the creepers who live
throughout this town can be heard from all around, giving off an eerie
buzzing sound that seems to get louder each second.  The large
boulders that make up the outskirts of the city can be seen quite
easily from this point.  The north appears to be closer to the
entrance of the city, while a couple shops can be seen to the south.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
Once again, the activity seems to pick up more and more as one
explores deeper into this strange city.  The hissing and humming
sounds continue to travel from one side of the city to the other.  It
is almost as if these loud noisy and booming sounds fly around the
air, bouncing off of one wall and travelling to the next in a repeated
pattern.  For some odd reason, the smell here is completely terrible
and awful.  Although it is a problem in other areas of the city, this
area is definitly one of the more grotesque-smelling places of the
Valley of the Creepers.  Exits lead north, south, and west.  The
street continues to the north and south, with many shops along the
way.  To the west is one of those shops.

Ozlin's Treasures~
~
Upon entering this store, a strange thing comes across those who
are just travelling here for the first time - all of the shops and
stores in this town are constructed out of caves.  Although this is
very awkward, the Creepers are completely accustomed to it and they
actually manage to pull it off quite well.  This den seems as if it
was not carved, but just created this way over the many years and
years that have gone by.  A faint glow seems to echo off of the top of
the stoney cave, giving off a mysterious and eerie glow.  This store
is one of the cheaper ones in the city.  Most of the business that
goes on inside of here is actually the buying and selling of illegal,
stolen goods or products.  This fact adds even more to the strangeness
of this entire place, especially this very store.  Fresh air can be
felt blowing in from the east.

A North/South Street in the City~

The street cutting through the Valley of the Creepers continues
north and south.  This section of the street is a bit more upbeat and
alive than the others, possibly due to the two stores on each side of
the street.  Caves constructed of great marble and stone can be seen
on the east and west side of the street.  The caves look quite
natural, although something says they have been artificially created
by the Creepers who reside here.  Looking at the cave to the west, one
can see the tall rocks and stones that cover the outside of the city. 
A bit into the distance southward, one can see a large tower that
seems to rise from the southeastern corner of the city.  Perhaps this
is some sort of lookout or guard tower?

Gorzo's Place~
~
A pretty bad smell rises out of this place.  This would be bad
enough, but it is made even worse when one discovers that this is
where all the Creepers come to buy their food and edibles.  Steam
rises up from various pots and pans that are littered around the cold,
hard ground.  Bits of old, rotten food has been thrown into a big pile
on a shelf, which barely clings to the side of the cave.  Insects and
bugs have found their way to this stack of food, each fighting for a
chance to bite into the rotten exterior of the food.  Opposite of the
loose shelf lies another shelf.  This one looks a bit more sturdy than
the other, but some strange instruments seem to be resting on top of
it.  These are apparently the tools used by Gorzo to create his food. 
One could easily get these confused for instruments of torture and
pain.  Maybe these tools serve as both?

Weapon Shop~
~
Large scraps of metal have been placed in various locations around
this cave.  Light from the outside has found its way into this cave,
and it shimmers off of the metal weapons that are found around this
dwelling.  The entrance to this cave is made up of little stones and
pebbles, but the rest of the Weapons Shop is crafted of rough dirt.  A
heat seems to emanate from one corner of the store.  Sitting in this
corner is a hot oven that assists in the melting and wielding of
certain weapons and tools.  The temperature increases with almost
every step forward towards this oven.  Finally, a couple weapons have
been left sitting around the cave, but they are all closely watched by
the store owner.

The walls that stand on the outside of the city rest just a bit to
the east.  The coloration of the ground is a bit faded and worn,
almost as if this is an ancient city after all.  Upon close inspection
of one particular stone, one can make out carved symbols and etchings
that must stand for something unknown to most.  Just a bit to the
south, the horizon is disturbed by the appearance of some sort of
watchtower at one corner of the city.  Various humming and buzzing
sounds can be heard coming from the east and west while the street
continues to the north and south.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
The street running through the city in the Valley of the Creepers
is nearly coming to a halt, as there is only a bit more road to the
south before coming to the humongous wall that serves to block off the
Creepers from the outside world.  The sounds of business and various
activities can be heard from all directions, especially to the
northern part of this street.  An assortment of debris can be seen
left on the side of this street, out of the way of any people passing
by but still causing a mess in the process.

A Creeper's Home~
~
Instead of finding a shop or store ran by a Creeper, this is what
some Creepers actually call home.  The air is thick with a putrid
smell similar to that of rotten flesh.  The cave's walls are smooth
for the most part, with the occassional bump or rough edge being found
upon detailed and meticulous inspection.  The ground of the cave is a
mix between dirt and marble with both having an equal share of the
space.  To some surprise, this cave is actually smaller than those
used for the shops or stores.  This must mean that this cave is only
home to one or two Creepers, as three or more would be much too
overcrowded.  This small cave really has nothing of much importance,
and the street lies just to the west.

A Creeper's Home~
~
The street outside can clearly be seen from inside this place. 
Apparently, this serves as a home a group of Creepers in this city. 
Although this is quite strange, those that live here have learned to
call it home over the last couple of years or so.  It is apparent that
this first 'room' in the cave served as a kitchen of some sort.  Pots
and pans have been left on a table that sits in the middle of the
cave.  The entire place is dirty and a pungent smell seems to float in
the air.  Another strange sight is the ladder which hangs from above. 
It is somehow being held up from above, but what lies above is
completely unknown.  A small flap over the entrance makes a feeble
attempt to hide any sunlight from the outside during the day to the
south.

A Creeper's Home - Upstairs~
~
The ladder leads to a short hallway that has somehow been carefully
crafted out of the marble that makes up the cave's walls and ceiling. 
Bits of water slowly drop at a repeated pace from above, falling
almost silently to the ground to form a slight puddle that oozes and
falls between even smaller cracks.  This short, dark hallway only
appears to extend a bit more to the west.  Some strange furniture sits
around this section of the hallway, constructed by a Creeper for a
Creeper.  The walls have also began to moisten as a result of the
dripping from the ceiling, but it is not exactly clear what the liquid
is.  Although it looks a bit normal, the texture seems more like slime
than regular water.  Swirls of colors can be seen in various spots on
the walls of the cave.  The ladder leads back down to the kitchen area
of the Creeper's home, while the hallway gets a bit darker to the
west.

The hallways come to an abrupt end when the cave walls enclose in a
semi-circle.  This part of the hallways actually does appear to serve
some sort of purpose, due to the three cots sitting on each side of
the aforementioned semi-circle.  The cots look like they are extremely
lacking in the comfort area as they are torn and ripped in lots of
places.  The sound of dripping water can be faintly heard coming from
the east end of the hallway.  Due to the three cots in this end of the
hallway, movement is incredibly limited and the place is quite stuffy
and crowded.  The usual strange smell is oddly missing from this
place, which is quite a surprise considering this is probably where
the Creepers rest at night.

An intersection~
~
The walls that have been found to the east now form a blockage to
the south.  The horizon is broken off by this large structure of
marble.  The structure appears to have been carved completely out of
stone, much like the other buildings or homes in this valley.  Dirt
makes up the ground here, but it disappears as one approaches the
southeastern tower to give way to granite or some sort of stone. 
Something odd also appears here, yet it seems normal at the exact same
time.  A short, green bush has begun to grow in the middle of the
street.  Plantlife is quite rare in this town, but this one has
managed to grow and flourish.  Merchants can be heard haggling with
shoppers over their wares to the north and west, as the street
continues in both directions.  Just to the east lies the southeastern
watchtower.

This road in the city runs east and west, giving acess to many
shops in the process.  Bits of garbage and debris have found their way
to this particular section of the road, littering it up and making it
look somewhat trashy.  Rubble has fallen from some of the stores or
houses that line this street.  Various caves and caverns can be seen
to the east and west, either giving Creepers a place to shop or a
place to live.  This part of the path is also extremely worn and
broken, with pieces of the slabs being broken numerous times over its
many years of existence.  A bit of noise can be heard to the east,
probably resulting from the intersection of this road and another. 
West is also a bit noisy because of the multiple shops and homes that
remain to be found.

Below the Southeastern Watchtower~
~
The southeastern corner of the Valley is home to the watchtower,
where Creepers are assigned to watch over the outside of the city. 
This proves that the Creepers are actually intelligent beings instead
of blood-thirsty predators like most would believe.  The watchtower
lies directly above, and with the aid of a ladder it is reachable. 
The watchtower has been constructed out of large slabs of marble and
stone.  Two lanterns sit on each side of the ladder, providing light
at night time.  The ladder itself is wooden, and a bit thicker that
normal ladders to provide support for the large race of Creepers who
reside in this town.  Above lies the part of the tower where guards
stand on patrol to overlook the outside of the city, and the city
itself lies back to the west, bustling with activity.

The Southeastern Watchtower~
~
The watchtower sits atop a large group of stones set down in
brick-like patterns.  The view from this point of the city is nearly
perfect for the guards who patrol here.  They can see the forest to
the east, as well as the land surrounding it.  The ladder has been
tied to the top of the watchtower, allowing almost any Creeper to use
it when needed.  The watchtower is a circular room with no top,
allowing access to the night's sky after dark.  Torches have been
placed in a circular pattern across the room, as well.  In certain
areas of the room, a slab of stone will rise up above the usual
stones.  This is to allow a place of protection should enemies attack
the city.  Looking back over the city shows a somewhat
peaceful-looking town, although the being here are disgusting and
grotesque.  Homes rest in their set places and shops are placed
strategically to make for the easiest possible route.  The ladder
leads back down to under the watchtower.

An East/West Street in the City~

The street closes in a bit more and creates an even more crowded
area in this part of the street.  The entrances to two stores rest on
the northern and southern sides of this path, soft blankets hanging
down over the entrances.  What exactly lies behind these blankets has
yet to be seen, and a bit of mystery is provided from the lack of
sight into the caves that stand there.  Looking farther down to the
west, one can see the southwestern watchtower.  This stands opposite
of the southeastern watchtower, which is just a bit to the east of
here.  Various wares that have been outdated have been dropped or
dumped around here.  These instruments have very little use it is
apparent.  The path begins to widen out to the east and west as the
street continues into the unknown.

An East/West Street in the City~

The street continues to the east and west here, leading to either
the southwestern watchtower or the southeastern one.  The wall to the
south blocking off the city from the outside still stands strong,
maybe reaching a bit higher in this particular section.  To the north,
an entrance to a cave can be seen.  This has come to be normal here in
the Valley of the Creepers, but something else will catch the eye of
those not familiar with this town.  On the outside of the cave is very
wet, moist sand and dirt.  The wetness is not from regular water,
though.  Instead, it appears as though some strange, green ooze has
been leaking from the northern cave.  A strong stench of odor also
seems to rise from this cave, or perhaps it is coming from the ooze. 
Either way, one not familiar and used to this city will want to avoid
this section of the town for the majority of their visit or stay. 
This street continues to the east and west, with the smelly cave lying

Examining the statue reveals that though the features are gone the

common design.  The globe in the statue's outstretched hand does not
appear to be attached by anything other than gravity.

An East/West Street in the City~
~
The stone road continues here, looking as steady as ever.  Close
attention to the road will show that this part has been worked on
repeatedly in the past.  Perhaps there were some sort of problems with
the stableness?  Those who were not around to witness the construction
will probably never know exactly what had to be fixed, but something
was wrong in this part of the town.  The wall to the south also looks
a little unstable, as there is a large crack running up the side which
appears to have been worked on in the past as well.  Some minute
pebbles and gems are assorted around on the ground in no particular
fashion.  If one hasn't thought this already upon searching the town,
the thought of how bland and plain this place appears will definitely
come into mind now.  A smell seems to drift in the air, floating over
from the east while somewhat fresh air comes in from the west.  This
creates a mixture of the two with numerous pockets of fresh air
between the overall stench that covers this particular area.

The gigantic statue is at least twenty feet tall and was obviously
at one time the center piece of the area.  However, time and the
acidic coating of slime has worn it to nothing more than an indiscrete
lump of stone.  Near the base of the statue a huge worn plaque is
visible.

plaque~
The inscription has been heavily worn but is still visible in most places.
The plaque reads:
"Make something up here possibly using some sort of code."
Translation should be something like Drizbach Lasore Father of <Town Name> & Chief Evomancer.

An East/West Street in the City~
~
The long street seems to come to no end, continuing yet again.  The
monotony of the stone road, southern wall, and sky above is
strategically broken up by the two homes that branch off from this
specific division of the route.  A couple buckets sit outside each of
the two houses, resting in the front of them for future use.  One of
these buckets is entirely filled with the strange, green ooze which
can be found in other parts of the town.  Only the Creepers would
really know what it is used for, but few outsiders would truly care to
find out.  On the other hand, a couple of the buckets have been turned
over.  A wet mark on the ground shows that each bucket was once
occupied by some sort of substance.  Looking above shows the very
clear sky, no trees or shrubbery blocking the view.  The street
continues to the east and west, with houses to the north and south.

An East/West Street in the City~
~
The long route leading east and west still continues on here, as it
comes to yet another section made up of stores and shops of various
types.  During the day, this spot has become well known for being
quite a hot area as a result from the shining sun directly overhead. 
At night, this place is a bet creepy, due to the two caves on either
side of the street.  A faint dripping sound can be heard almost always
coming from the northern cave, while multiple sounds echo in from the
southern cave.  This entire place is as if it never sleeps or rests,
just nonstop activity at all times of the day.  Some of the sunlight
during the day is blocked off and turned into large shadows from the
large wall to the south that runs completely around the city.  Some of
the shadows cover up parts of the street and completely engulf the
southern cave, creating a spooky atmosphere for some reason.  The
street goes on to the east and west, with a cave on the northern and
southern sides.

Training Area~
~
This cave has a mat of some sort placed on the ground to help from
any damage that might be done by falling down hard on the ground. 
Instead of the usual shop or home one would expect to find, this
particular cave is used to train some of the Creepers in the art of
fighting and combat.  There is one Creeper who is always on duty.  He
is very wise and strong.  He has donated his life to the teaching of
younger Creepers.  There is also a training dummy which sits in the
corner of the room, off of the mat.  The street lies back to the
south, where another store can be seen even further south.

This particular cave serves as a cave.  This comes to a huge
surprise to most people, as it is hard to imagine the Creepers
actually using currency.  This race is obviously a lot more advanced
than they appear to be.  The cave is actually cut in half by a large,
wooden wall.  There is a small opening in the middle of the wall,
offering a space for customers to come in and talk to the money
changer who is working.  Safety is taken very seriously here, and the
Creeper behind the counter will usually be cautious when changing
money with someone he or she doesn't know too well.  The cave's exit
is to the north, and one can find a street in that direction.

This part of the street is quite similar to the rest, old and worn
out.  There is nothing much more than dirt to be found on this part of
the trail.  One would probably wonder just how old this town really
is, since there is nothing new except for a few of the inventive ideas
created by some of the various shopkeepers throughout this town. 
There are two caves on either side of this street, and the both of
them appear to be regular homes from the outside.  There is nothing
really important to the south, but there is another cave to the north.
This cave appears to be yet another home, but nothing else important. 
The northeastern watchtower can be found even further to the north,
while the southeastern one is a bit in the distance to the south.

The cave to the west has two large mounds of dirt on either side of
the entrance.  It sits opposite of the eastern wall, which is used for
protection.  The eastern wall is actually one huge wall which rises up
far above the ground.  The only places higher in this town are the
watchtowers, which sit in all four corners of the city.  This wall
does the job of blocking off the city from outsiders.  There is only
one entrance and one exit to the city, unless someone has created a
secret, hidden one that is unknown to the Creepers.  That is very
doubtful, though.  The street continues to the north and south.  The
northeastern watchtower gets closer to the north, while two caves lie
to the south.

This particular division of the road is mostly just used to connect
the street to the intersection which lies to the north.  There is
always a lot of traffic along the intersection, because that is where
people go to travel from one street to another.  The northeastern
watchtower lies to the northeast, unsurprisingly.  There looks to be
the remains of an old cave to the west, but the entrance has been
caved in and completely blocked off.  There really isn't anything
special there, but one would hope no one got hurt too bad when the
dwelling did cave in.  The intersection lies to the north, and there
is a bit more traffic than usual in that direction.  One cave can be
seen to the south, with much more lying beyond it.

~
This intersection serves as a meeting point for the northern road,
which goes east and west, and the eastern street, which goes north and
south along the city.  The northeastern watchtower lies just a bit to
the east, and one can see it standing far above the walls that
surround it.  Also, the northern wall goes on to meet the eastern wall
just over to the east.  This creates the northeastern corner of the
Creeper town.  The one major thing to be found on the street to the
west, aside from the many homes that are found, is the Creeper Inn,
which serves as a place to rest, eat, and sleep for the outsiders who
travel here for adventure.  The southern street has a good variety of
shops, probably more than any other street in the town of the
Creepers.  There are two benches which have been placed here in an
attempt to break up the monotony and repetitveness of the streets, but
it fails at its job just a bit.

This part of the road makes up the northern area of the city, and
it travels from the east side of the town to the opposite side.  There
is a huge wall that stands to the north of here, blocking off the city
from any outside intruders who might look to sneak inside the city. 
Back to the east, one can see the watchtower that also aids in the
protection of the city.  The road is constructed of large slabs of
rock, and it looks as if it has just naturally been created over time.
There isn't really much of anything else interesting to be found or
seen, except for the large cave that sits to the west.  There is an
intersection to the east which connects with a road that runs from the
northeastern end of the city to the southeastern end.

This part of the street has a very large cave to the south.  It
could be the biggest cave in this entire town.  Also, for those who
have ventured into this city before in the past, they will know that
the southern cave is the Creeper Inn.  It really isn't used by much
Creepers, but it shows the hospitality of the Creepers.  They have
allowed one entire cave to be used for outsiders and adventurers. 
This isn't even found in some of the other, bigger cities, but it
really is a necessity for good, well-planned towns.  The street
continues to the east and west, with the northern wall blocking off
any exits in that particular direction.  It seems as though there is
an absence of any caves to the east, but the west has two caves on
each side of the street.

Two caves of average side sit on either side of the street.  There
doesn't really seem to be anything too exciting besides the two caves.
The ground is the same as it is through the entire city, and the
northern wall blocks off any view of the plains or plantlife that lies
to the north of the town.  The streets seem somewhat dead, aside from
the many Creepers who travel to and from their homes or stores.  No
plantlife or greenery is to be seen.  It is even a rumor that
plantlife ever existed in this town.  This adds to the strangeness of
the Creepers just a bit, but it doesn't mean they are evil.  Most of
the Creepers are actually peaceful and harmless, even though they are
horrid and ugly in appearance.  The street continues to the east and
west, with one cave to be found in either direction.

This part of the street is completely covered by dirt and sand that
has been broken up.  It looks like all of this was once clay, but it
has been hardened and broken up to dirt and sand.  Some of the smaller
stone tablets that were used in the early construction of this path
are now lost under the mass of broken up clay.  They are still
present, though, which is evident by the toughness of the ground in
certain spots.  There is a cave to the north, which has a bit of smoke
coming from it.  There is also some sort of bubbling sound that floats
in from the inside of the cave.  The fabric that hangs over the
entrance is not torn at all, which is different from most of the
caves.  The street continues to the east and west, with two well-sized
caved to the east and one to the west.

A large cave stands just to the south, with a bit of trash and
discarded materials littered around the ground on the outside of the
dwelling for some odd reason.  It looks quite trashy, but that is
nothing new in this city.  These Creepers are very strange creatures. 
They look mean and disgusting, but they are actually peaceful and
civilized.  They might be civilized, but they can also be messy and
trashy.  Overall, one would probably be better off just looking around
and leaving.  This would probably be one of the least popular places
to live for any outsiders, as they cannot be used to the lifestyles of
the Creepers.  The street continues to the east and west, with a cave
to the east.

This part of the path really has nothing special to be seen.  No
caves are located off of here, only the path itself.  The large wall
to the north still stands here, steady and stable as ever.  This part
of the path looks exactly the same as the rest, except for the lack of
anything interesting.  Clay has crumbled into small grains of dirt
over the years of its existence, and nothing seems to want to grow in
this town, either.  There is a cave visible to the east.  It looks a
bit messy in that direction, too, probably as a result of the cave
over there.  There is nothing directly to the west, but there is a
shop or home of some sort a bit further.

This part of the road has been kept up really well, which is a big
change from the rest of this street.  There is a couple of mounds of
dirt on either side of the street, but they have been swept there to
make the path as clear as possible.  The usually broken up stone
tablets that make up the streets all over this town are kept in tact,
as they all remain together.  This is a very rare sight to see in this
town, as most of the place is terribly trashy and messed up.  The
Creepers must take a lot of pride in this single part of the road. 
Maybe this is the last remaining tablet that is still together in one
piece.  The street continues to the east and west.  Nothing looks to

There is a bright cave that sits to the south, light seemingly
pouring out of it.  This is just another of the many strange things to
be found in this city.  There are plenty of caves that have strange
lights, sounds, or smells all across the city.  The opening of this
cave is actually quite clean compared to some of the others.  This
must be because of the road to the east, which is also exceptionally
clean.  It seems as though the Creepers have tried to really take care
of this section of town.  Maybe this particular division is very
historic.  There are many possibilities as to why this is like it is,
but outsiders will probably never know the truth.  The street
continues to the east and west.  There is nothing of real intersest in
either direction.  A bit in the distance to the west lies the
northwestern watchtower, where Creeper guard stand watch at all times
of the day in case unwanted intruders should ever approach the city.

The street begins to get a little more worn and worn as one travels
to the west.  To the east, the street had begun to get nice and taken
care of, but now it has lost all of that well-being and turned into
the normal streets that are found throughout the town of the Creepers.
The dirt that was once placed on the outsides of the path is now
cluttering up the entire path, offering no view of the stone tablets
that rest on the ground and serve as the true road.  The northwestern
watchtower gets closer and closer with each step, while the
northeastern watchtower becomes further and further away at the same
time.  To the east, a wide array of multi-colored lights shines out of
a cave, lighting up the ground around it on the outside as well. 
There is one cave to the west, but there is also an intersection on
past it.

Lots of traffic comes in from the west, where there is an
intersection between two roads.  This road meets the western street of
the city which goes from the northwestern area to the southwestern
area.  Just like most of the places along this road, there is a lot of
dirt that has been built up in the middle of the street.  This makes
the place look pretty messy.  The northern wall also has two large
piles of dirt that rest up against it.  There is a cave to the north
of here, right before the wall.  Nothing too special can be seen from
here, but maybe there is something interesting inside of the cave. 
The street continues to the east, but meets up with another road to

This area is where two different roads connect and meet each other.

which runs north and south.  Also, the northwestern watchtower sits
just to the west of this spot.  One can see a ladder hanging down to
the west, allowing one to climb up into the watchtower.  This
particular road is usually quite crowded and cluttered with Creepers,
as they are either going to the east, west, or south.  Most of the
city occupants actually travel to the south from here, on their way to
the Tavern that lies on the southern street.  One can see plenty of
caves in the southern and eastern directions, almost every one serving
a different purpose.  Overall, this spot has quite a bit of options
for the traveller, and it is usually somewhat crowded by the Creepers,
too.

This is the beginning of the road going along the western side of

the north, and it looks somewhat busy compared to the rest of the
street to the south.  The northwestern watchtower is to the northwest,
standing tall above the western wall which sits just to the west. 
There is a small cave to the west, standing right before the
protective wall that surrounds the city.  The cave is smaller than the
average caves, but it definitely isn't the smallest one that can be
found here in the town.  There are probably smaller ones somewhere
that can be found with just a bit of searching and patience.  The
street continues to the south, but there really isn't anything of
interest directly south.  One must travel beyond that to find more
shops, homes, and other caves which have varying purposes.  Once
again, the intersection is to the north, and there seems to be quite a
bit of activity in the direction.

Perhaps the most interesting part of this road is the view of the
northwestern watchtower which is just a bit to the north.  It stands
up very tall, overlooking the outside and inside of this tremendous
and unique town.  The western wall sits right here, too, but the tower
is just a bit higher than the wall.  This allows the guards who are on
duty to see completely everything going on within the city and on the
outside.  Back a bit in the distance to the south is the southwestern
watchtower.  It looks exactly the same as the northern one, just as
high and just as big.  There are two caves to the south, both of which
looks to be homes.  One looks as if it has been a bit trashed over the
many years of its existence, while the other looks nicely kept.  An
intersection sits a bit to the north, but there is one cave to be
found before reaching the intersection.

This division of the street is usually crowded and cluttered with
Creepers on their way to and from their houses.  Although the city
really lacks much activity to outsiders, there is quite a bit to do in
this town.  There are many different stores for shopping, a tavern, an
inn, and plenty of other places to find excitement and activity.  One
must just be open-minded about the fact that the Creepers are very
different from most of the other races found in the Realms.  Two homes
sit on either side of the street here, both serving as homes for some
of the Creepers who reside in this city.  Aside from those two
dwellings, there really isn't anything else of importance.  There is a
cave to the south, but nothing but road to the north.  Looking further
north, one will notice that the northwestern watchtower is much closer
all of a sudden.  The southwestern tower is much further away, and it
seems as if this just happens all of a sudden.

A North/South Street in the City~

This particular road has now become extremely monotonous and
boring.  The shops and houses are supposed to break up and end the
monotony, but it really doesn't help.  One can only stay interested in
these places for a short time before getting tired of how boring the
streets truly are.  There are stone tablets making up the street, and
they have been broken up just like the rest of the city apparently. 
Overall, one would probably deduce that this is just a very old,
secluded city which really means no harm to the outside world.  The
Creepers probably just want to keep to themselves and be left alone,
but there is only a matter of time before they are brought into some
kind of conflict or disagreement.  It is quite a surprise how calm and
peaceful these disgusting creatures are, but there is no telling just
how much damage they can do should they be angered or tempted.  There
is an average-sized cave dwelling to the east, which homes a couple of
Creepers.  To the south, one can find various tools littering the road
and a shop for the selling and purchasing of tools as well.  Two homes
stand to the north, giving the Creeper population even more places to
rest and live.

Various objects of some sort have been left around this part of the
street.  Most of them are directly outside of the eastern cave, but
there are a few that have found their way to the middle of the street.
These tools are mostly wooden, but there are a few metal objects
sitting around in the dirt.  As a result of their placement, they have
all become quite dirty and the metal ones have begun to rust with
time.  The cave to the east is probably where these tools have come
from, but exactly why they have been left here remains unknown. 
Perhaps these were the broken tools.  One would probably not know
unless he or she was a Creeper, since these tools all look for The
entrance to the cave lies to the east, while the street continues to
the north and south.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
This path through the city seems very similar to the rest of the
city.  It is truly beginning to get repetitive now, and nothing really
looks new on the street, minus the caves that might be off of each
area.  There is an absence of any caves to the east or west, so there
is pretty much nothing of real interest here.  Instead of seeing a
large cave or really anything, the only visible things to the east are
the caves that sit far off in the distance, across the entire town
near the entrance.  This very street continues to the north and south,
with caves being visible in either of the two directions one might
choose to proceed with.

A North/South Street in the City~

The most noticeable thing about this section is the very small cave
to the east.  A very small piece of fabric hangs over the cave's
entrance, blowing in a soft wind from the inside of the cave.  The
dirt looks as if it has been here forever.  It has become grey and
hard over the past.  A couple small cracks can be found in the dirt,
showing just how old this town really is.  The tiny den to the east
looks quite difficult to enter for most of the normal-sized Creepers. 
It is very obvious that some of the bigger Creepers have no way at all
of entering the cave.  Most outsiders would probably wonder what
exactly that cave is used for.  The only way to find out is to venture
into it.  If the cave doesn't sound appealing, one can continue to
venture throughout the town by going either north or south along the
street.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
The North/South Street continues here.  A huge cave can be found to
the east of this area.  The entrance is much bigger than most caves'
entrances, and two large cloths have been used to cover it up.  About
three or four stones have been placed in an attempt to be decorative. 
They sit near the base of the entrance, and provide a bit of help when
entering the cave, as there is a large mount of dirt which must be
stepped over upon entrance.  Small bugs have found this mound of sand
and clay to be their new home.  These bugs are incredibly small, and
some of them fly around over the large stack of dirt.  Once again,
there is a complete absence of any plantlife.  Some say that there is
only one or two small plants or greenery to be found in the entire
city.  The street continues to the north and south.  The southwestern
watchtower can be seen not too far south, while far in the distance
stands the northwestern watchtower.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
This section of the street runs north and south, but the most
important things in this area are definitely the two homes which rest
on each side of the street.  To the west, a large cave stands tall and
very near to the western wall of the city.  A cave which is a bit
smaller can be found to the east.  Each of these dwellings has the
regular piece of fabric over the opening in the front.  A couple of
holes have been cut in each one, too, which sees light pass through it
during the day.  The glow of the moon will also help light up the
insides of the caves just a bit.  One well-sized dwelling can be found
to the north, as well.  It appears as though it is one of the bigger
caves to be found in this town.  Nothing of real importance lies to
the south, just another part of this very path going from the
northwestern area of the town to the southwestern.

A North/South Street in the City~
~
The street truly starts here, as the intersection lies south of
this division.  There are many dwellings that have been built off of
this street up ahead to the north.  It seems as though each step leads
to a house, shop, or both.  There is absolutely no plant life to be
found here, much like the rest of the city.  The western wall stands
here, too.  It began to the south, but it continues a great deal to
the north.  After walking around the city for a bit, one will begin to
see how plain and repetitive it really is.  Aside from the different
shops and homes, nothing else seems different.  All of the streets are
the exact same in appearance.  Once again, this street is littered
with stones and dirt, much like the rest of the Creeper's town.  There
is an intersection which lies to the south, and it appears as though
there are two caves to the north.

~
The road running east and west through the Creepers' town continues
here, with little action going on as compared to the other areas of
the road.  This is probably a result of the complete lack of any
stores in this part of the road.  Instead, it looks as if it is only
used to connect one part of the street to the other.  It appears as
though it has done that job well, too, as the street looks completely
worn out from the travel that takes place every single day.  Aside
from the wall that stands to the south, nothing of real interest can
be located here.  The wall itself is used mainly for protection from
outside forces that would look to detroy the town.  A great deal of
the walkway is covered by the shadows of the southern wall, which
gaves a cooler place to walk when the daytime becomes too hot to
handle.  The street continues to the east and west, with two houses to
the east and a store to the west.

The main attraction on this division of the road is the strange
noises coming from the south.  It appears as if some sort of animals
that are making the noise.  A small hut stands before the southern
wall, with about three pins behind it.  The strange animal noises
float over from the pins, and curiosity definitely comes into play
here.  One can view the enormous city by glancing to the north, where
various caves have been constructed off in the distance.  These caves
are mostly brown or red in color, and most of them all appear to be
about the same size.  The road continues to the east and west, each
way covered up just a bit by the shadows created by the huge wall
standing tall to the south.  An assortment of broken stones can be
found sitting around on each side of this street, broken off by the
many years of repeated use.

The path running east and west along the southern end of the city
continues once again here.  One can actually hear the sounds of moans
coming from the east, probably coming from the slaves who are bought
and sold at the Pet Shop.  The southern wall takes a small dip in its
usually overwhelming size to look a little bit shorter than usual. 
The bits of clay that surround the path and wall have really begun to
dry up due to the hot days that take place in the Creeper's village. 
This has led to the formation of three or four large cracks in the
ground.  Although nothing dangerous, they still have a strange
appearance and it just adds to the overall weirdness of the Creepers
and their town.  The path continues to the east and west, with the Pet
Shop being found to the east, and a Creeper's home of some sort
visible to the west.

This part of the city is really overtaken by the humongous wall to
the south.  It dipped a bit to the west, but it gets much larger in
this section.  The usually white or grey stones found to make up the
streets now turn into a reddish or brownish color.  Also, the wall to
the south hard large cracks in the ground around it to the west, but
it has been just fine in this division of the road, showing no cracks
and perfect stability.  There is a large cave standing to the north,
directly across from the southern wall.  A bit of traffic seems to be
coming in from the west, as there is an intersection where this road
meets another road that goes from the southern part of the city to the
northern area.  There is also the southwestern watchtower in view now,
as it stands up at the same level of the wall which surrounds the
city.  One can see this tower just a few paces to the west, while the
southeastern one also sits far to the east on the entire opposi

An Intersection~
~
An intersection between two roads sits here.  The first road goes
east and west through the southern area of town, while the second road
goes north and south through the western part of town.  This is the
first point where the two roads meet.  The southwestern watchtower can
be seen over to the west, standing tall on the wall.  The Creepers
have learned to use this for the protection of their city, and they
probably use it for some other purposes, too.  To the north, the
second street runs from here to the northwestern part of town.  It
looks quite busy, and there are a bit more caves and dwellings on that
road than to the east and down that path.  The eastern/western street
still continues just a tad bit more to the west, where one can find
the guard's watchtower.  It also continues to the east, where a
Creeper's home sits just a bit down that way.  North leads to the
North/South street in the city.

Below the Southwestern Watchtower~
~
The large watchtower sits just a bit overhead.  Like the three
other watchtowers in this town, there is a ladder which leads up into
the inside of the tower.  The orange, wooden ladder is hanging from
somewhere inside the watchtower.  It appears as though the tower was
constructed out of large rock, which would explain the stability of
the place.  If one chooses not to journey up to the tower, the only
other possible exit is to the east, which leads to an intersection
between two roads.  There is another intersection of sorts here.  To
the west, the western wall of the city stands.  It meets up with the
southern wall in the very southwestern corner, which is found right
here.

The northwestern watchtower sits just above, a ladder hanging down
from the inside of the tower.  This is the place where guards stand on
watch to make sure no one is coming to harm the city.  The Creepers
will usually let groups of three people or less, but once large armies
start approaching, they are ordered to make note of it and report. 
This particular part of the watchtower is made of stones and set up in
a circular way.  The tower above is also one big circle.  One can see
up above pretty clearly, so there is not much mystery or surprise on
the way.  There is an intersection to the east, where two different
roads meet and Creepers travel from one to another, too.

The northeastern watchtower is directly overhead, only accessable
via the ladder which hangs down from the inside of it.  The tower is
made out of stones and rocks, just like the other three towers which
reside in each corner of the city.  This is also the place where the
northern wall meets the eastern wall, truly making this the
northeastern corner of the town.  As if it still hasn't been figured
out, these towers serve as a means for protection.  Guards are always
on duty and they are ordered to report if any large quantities of
beings are approaching the town, whether or not they look harmless. 
The intersection lies to the west, where the northern street of the
city meets the eastern one.  Other than that, the only exit is to
venture above to the watchtower.

A Smelly Cave~
~
The appearance of this cave is not what stands out the most about
it.  What stands out for the most part is the absolutely horrid and
fowl stench and odor that just runs throughout this cave.  The
terrible smell seems to suffocate those unsuspecting beings that
travel into this cave, clouding them in a thick haze of odor.  The
middle of the cave is definitely the worst, and it seems to thin out a
bit as one retreats further from the center.  But no place in this
cave is completely safe from the smell, as if a predator was lurking
around every shadow ready to pounce on their pray.  The source of the
smell remains unknown for the moment being, but perhaps the question
will be answered at one point.  The cave is very bare and there is
absolutely nothing of interest to be found.  No tables, cots, shelves,
tools - nothing!  Instead, a set of stairs have been formed out of the
very cave itself, making a way upwards into the unknown.  For those a
little nervous about exploring further, the road can be found back to
the south past the fabric hanging over the entrance.

A Smelly Cave~
~
This portion of the cave is no different than the rest in smell. 
The stench still lingers around in the air, making it more and more
difficult to continue searching and travelling into this large cave. 
The cave is incredibly dark, and it is almost impossible to see
without the aid of magic or a lantert of some sort.  A tiny glimpse of
light does seem to be coming in from below, but it is just a small
amount that really doesn't help anything at all.  Something else
catches the attention of new travellers - the buzzing sound that seems
to be coming in from the north.  The purpose of this cave is
completely unknown, and it gets even more mysterious with each room
entered.  Something eerie is going on, and many travellers would not
think twice about turning back and heading out into the open city for
safety.  The stairs leading below would do just that, while true
adventurers might want to go north to find out exactly what is going
on here.

A Smelly Cave~
~
This part of the cave seems to branch off and form two separate
paths.  Where each path leads to is a complete mystery, but one should
probably be very careful when choosing which direction to go.  The
cave comes to a halt to the north, with a large wall of dirt and stone
blocking entry.  Instead, it gives way to two new exits to the east
and west.  Both of which lead deeper into the cave.  The smell is also
still as horrid as before, and the loud droning sound seems to get
louder and louder with each step forward.  Clumps of clay, or some
sort of dirt, have formed in large piles around this part of the cave,
serving no purpose at all.  The top of the cave seems to be moving a
bit, as if it is vibrating for some reason.  Further exploration would
probably answer any and all questions about this smelly cave.

A Smelly Cave~
~
The eastern part of the cave is lit up by a strange, green glow the
seems to float down from above.  Much like before, the cave has
somehow been constructed into a staircase-like path that leads above
into the unknown.  The glow bounces off of the cave walls a bit, but
if fades out before travelling back west.  The smell that fills up the
entire cave is still very much present.  The green glow shines off of
the brown and grey cave walls, forming an eerie place altogether. 
Also, a slight buzzing sound can be heard from above, as if some sort
of Creeper business was being conducted in that area.  The ground is
quite hard and gives little comfort on the shoes of those who choose
to walk this path.  It seems as if there are quit a few different
things going on in this division of the cavern, but there is still a
mystery as to what exactly is going on.  The slight slope leading
upwards continues into the unknown, while those who choose not to take
the risk can exit to the west.

A Smelly Cave~
~
The western portion of the cave is lit up by some unknown light
source from above.  Anything in the cave is easily seen as a result of
this overpowering light.  As for the senses, the smell of this cave is
still there, but it is shoved to the back of an adventurer's mind to
make way for the immense, green glow that radiates from above.  A cold
wind also blows in from above, although one can be almost certain that
there is no opening at the top of the cave for this wind to enter the
cave from.  The red and brown walls of the clay look quite stable and
lacking of any danger, but perhaps the true danger of this cave lies
just above.  Similar to before, the cave itself has been molded or
constructed to somehow form a staircase of sorts which leads up into
the bright, glowing light that suffocates this room.  One can go about
leaving the cave by travelling to the east.

A Smelly Cave~
~
This division of the cave almost glitters with the green glow that
has now come to enchant the cavern.  Although the glow seems to be too
much to handle, one can make out little objects resting all over this
part of the cave.  The rancid smell that has been here all along gets
much stronger here, too.  With each step closer to the objects, one
can begin to make them out more and more.  They are actually egg-like
objects that rest on the ground, as big as a human.  Green and blue
spots rest on the white, outer-shell of these eggs.  Also, upon closer
inspection, it appears as though the horrid smell is actually a result
of these eggs.  Apparently, these eggs are how the Creepers are
spawned, and for some reason they naturally give off an extremely
appalling essence.  The radiant green glow gets much brighter in the
section of the cave to the east, while it decolorizes a great amount
below.

Breeding Grounds~
~
Two large crystals sit on each side of the room and the light
source is exposed.  These two crystals radiate a heavy, green glow
that serves almost no purpose at all except to help in sight.  These
two crystals are nearly as big as the eggs that surround them.  Each
egg looks exactly the same, as they are spotted with green and blue
specks.  The light from the two crystals shines upon them, bouncing
from one egg to another and finally going to the eastern and western
sections of the cave.  Near the center of a room sits shells that once
formed an egg, broken and cracked.  Perhaps a young Creeper was
hatched, or maybe the egg was accidently or purposely destroyed by
someone.  The light flickers a bit every now and then, adding even
more to the overall atmosphere of the cave.  The smell still floats
around here, as well.  The crystals do not seem to shine to the north,
as they are set to face only the eggs it seems.  This causes darkness
to fall to the north, while the east and west are very lit up.

A Smelly Cave~
~
This part of the cave is incredibly bright, almost too much for the
regular being's senses to handle.  The lights shines down onto the
staircase leading below, as if it was walking step by step downwards,
fading out a bit in the process.  The walls of the cave are almost too
bright to see, shining and glistening with the radiant green glow that
takes up the entire cavern as of now.  A strong, putrid smell still
lingers about the air, but the senses are almost completely focused in
on the dazzling green brilliance which illuminates the cave.  One must
pay close attention to the ground, as various bumps have been formed
over the past.  Something else will catch the eye of travellers and
adventurers - this place is actually used for something.  Placed
around the room are large, egg-like objects.  Getting closer to these
eggs will cause the horrible stench to increase, so these are probably
the cause of the fowl odor which has completely taken over the entire
cave.  The powerful glow seems to brighten up more to the west, while
fading out a bit below.

Breeding Grounds~

This is the very back of the cave.  It looks as though nearly
hundreds of eggs are here, all waiting for their moment to hatch and
bring a new life into this world.  It is completely dark, and without
magical aid or a light source of some sort, there is almost no hope
for geting around in this part of the cave.  This is the actual area
where the Queen Creeper resides, preparing to birth new young each day
it seems.  The light source from the south can be seen just a bit, but
it doesn't help at all.  The eggs are all spotted green and blue, and
some of them have already hatched, bringing new, baby Creepers into
the world.  There are almost always guards here, protecting the Queen
from anyone who might attempt to attack her.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This cave is quite dark compared to some of the other Creeper's
homes.  The opening of the cave is covered by some sort of fabric,
much like the other homes, but very little light is allowed in.  This
is quite a small home, too, so it probably only houses one or two
Creepers at the most.  A couple of puddles have formed in corners of
the cave, but it is not the regular ooze that seems to populate most
houses.  Instead, it does indeed appear to be water, which is a rarity
in the Valley.  A medium-sized table sits in the back against the wall
of the cave, two chairs set on each side of it.  Various pots have
gathered up to form a big mess on the table.  Little specks of light
seem to creep in and land right on the few objects of importance in
the cave.  Light shines down on the tabletop, as well as managing to
hit a strange instrument in another corner.  This instrument appears
to be made of wood.  It has two sticks tied together and tied again to
two more sticks.  Perhaps this is a strange weapon of the Creepers? 
Back to the south, one must prepare to adjust their eyes to the
increase in light that immenently awaits.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This cave serves home to an unkown amount of Creepers.  Compared to
the Creeper's home on the opposite side of the street from this one,
this is a much bigger and better housing area.  Things are somewhat
neat, instead of the usual cluttered houses of the Creepers that
reside in this town.  The fabric hanging over the entrance has been
torn and ripped in places, so the light seems to float in freely from
the north, shining off of various instruments and tools that sit in
this house.  The walls of the cave have a rough appearance, but small
drops of water trinkle down and will eventually smoothe them out.  The
entrance to the cave is made of dirt, and has been damaged greatly
over the many years this home has been standing.  The dirt has almost
gave way to the solid rock that lies below.  Back north leads to the
city, and a street that runs easy and west.

Qorton's Supply Shop~
~
A dark, musky cave with rare spots of light showing in certain
places serves as the shop of Qorton, a Creeper who has become quit
wealthy through his work.  A strange thing about this cave is the cot
located in the back of it, which is obviously for the store owner to
sleep or rest in on his breaks.  Evidently, Qorzo not only works here,
but he also lives here, which becomes clearer upon the sight of his
cot and other necessary living equipment that has been scattered
about.  In front of the cot sits a large counter, cutting off the
customers from Qorzo.  Qorzo has somehow managed to cut the fabric so
the sun will shine right towards his counter during the day, giving
the buyer and seller a good view while conducting the business that
goes on here.  What exactly Qorzo sells is unknown for most outsiders,
as gifts for the Creepers could be something entirely different for
other races.  A piece of torn fabric falls down to the south, showing
the exit back to the outside street in the city.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This room is uncontrollably cold and frosty due to some unknown
force.  The Creepers of the village just say that it is because this
cave sits under the shadows of the southern wall, but that would not
cause such a drastic change in temperature.  Obviously, there is some
strange happenings going on in this town, but one would probably be
smarter to ignore them and go about his or her business.  The cave
itself is very similar to the other housing caves in the city, a
regular cave that is quite dark for the most part.  Bits of
precipitation have accumulated in various spots, mostly dripping to
the floor and forming puddles.  What exactly the liquid is remains to
be seen.  The usual foul smell of the caves is actually lost here,
which seems very strange considering how different the temperature is
from the others.  There are the basic elements to make up a housing
area here - cots, fabrics, kitchen utensils, and other tools.  This is
one of the more plain houses in the Valley, minus the strange
temperature difference.

Wylke's Potions~
~
This cave is average in width and height, but there is something
special about it.  All around the room are small, circular wooden
tables.  Each table has a glass container sitting atop it.  What is
really strange is the liquid that floats around in each container. 
Smoke rises out of each glass container, reaching the top of the cave
and floating to the outside where it launches up into the open air
until it disappears.  A counter sits directly to the left of the
entrance, where a Creeper waits to help the customers.  This must be a
potion shop, but no one really knows if these potions are helpful or
not.  One should remember how strange the Creepers truly are, so as
not to make a mistake and quaff one of their potions without making
sure it is completely safe.  There is also a strange, cold mist that
seems to blow around this cave, hitting the fabric over the entrance
and causing it to blow up in a southern direction.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This cave is a little bit bigger than normal.  This allows room for
the huge table which sits here.  It is about twice the size of the
tables found in other Creepers' homes.  It has room for six stools to
sit, but one gets the idea that six Creepers don't live here.  Perhaps
the family that does live here just likes to have big groups of
Creepers over to eat with.  There are two cots on the ground behind
the table, so there is probably only two Creepers who live here. 
There is a shelf to the right, and there is also one to the left of
the entrance.  Each shelf has pots, pans, and other clay structures
which are used as instruments of some sort.  There is one rug centered
in the dwelling, leading up to the table before coming to a halt. 
Altogether, this cave is quite similar to the rest, just a little bit
bigger.  The exit lies to the north, where a street can be found.  It
is the northern street, and it goes from the northwestern area of the
town to the northeastern division.

A Creeper's Home~
~
The cave is quite dark here because of the placement of this
particular spot.  The light barely reaches the whole cave above, so it
obviously won't reach down here.  There are five cots to be found in
this spot, so this must serve as the place in the cave used for
sleeping and resting.  The eating area is above, along with a place
where the younger Creepers of the family go to play with their strange
toys.  Aside from the cots, there is a shelf or two in the corner. 
They look to be filled with a couple pairs of clothes, but nothing too
flashy or important.  The ladder also sits here, connected to the
walls of the cave.  This gives access to the top part of the cave,
which leads back to the street if one so desires.

The Crystal Shop~
~
This dwelling serves as a shop for the selling of crystals.  These
crystals are incredibly bright, and one has a difficult time looking
at them for too long.  There are four different colors of light all
shining at once.  {RRed{x, {Ggreen{x,{B blue{x, and{y yellow{x lights are all present
inside this cave, although they may be a little too bright to handle
for some.  There are many crystals sitting around the room, and that
really seems to be about the only things here.  There is a wooden
counter which comes up to the waist of the owner, who is standing
beside it.  The cave's exit is to the north, which leads to a street
that goes around the entire city.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This home is very unique.  Instead of the normal entrance, this
cave entrance is long and leads to a very small, enclosed dwelling
area.  There is only one cot for use, so this must be owned by just
one Creeper opposed to most of the houses that give living areas to
large families.  There is only one very small, wooden table, too. 
Most houses have one big table that stretches from one side to the
other, but this dwelling has the one very small one.  There is also a
small bench beside the table, giving the one Creeper who lives here a
place to sit.  Not much caves here in this town house less than two or
three Creepers, so this is definitely a unique house.  There really
isn't much else to be seen.  The exit lies to the south, which leads
to the northern street through the city.

Pet Shop~
~
This cave serves as a pet shop, but very few people would expect to
see what they actually sell as pets.  A pungent smell fills up this
cave, which has become somewhat common here in the town of the
Creepers.  Some straw has actually been placed around the cave for
some unknown reason, perhaps to accompany the pets that are kept here.
Various noises and voices can be heard coming from the inside here. 
Also, there are about four or five different pins, each housing some
sort of animal.  Closer inspection of these pins will absolutely
frighten most outsiders who adventure here.  The first pin actually
holds a kobold!  The second pin holds a young human!  The third pin
holds a small satyr.  How the Creepers have managed to cage these
three animals is unknown and quite frightening, too.  Each of the
three animals inside the cage looks as if they are very tired and weak
from starvation, physical abuse, or some other form of punishment. 
Behind the three pins sits a wooden counter where people do business
over the three enslaved creatures.  Also beside each pin sits a small
bucket of some sort of feed.  This food is some sort of pellets that
looks completely repulsive and disgusting.  Finally, the fabric
blocking off the entrance of the cave from the outside can be passed
by to go back to the road on the outside.  That serves as the only
exit in this pet shop.

The Southwestern Watchtower~
~
This tower overlooks the entire outside of the city.  It stands
very tall, and rests just a bit higher than the walls that surround
the city.  There is nothing more than rolling plains to the west of
the city, and the south has a couple hills followed by a large forest.
These views are quite a distance from this town where the Creepers
reside.  Looking back across the town, one can see three other
watchtowers, one standing in each corner of the city.  There are four
holders located in the four directions in this tower.  Each of these
holders has the sole job of holding a torch during the darkest hours
of the night.  There is always a Creeper or two here, as well.  This
is the very last line of defense, and perhaps the only line of defense
at all.  One can enjoy the wonderful, amazing view of the town which
lies to the northeast.  Access to the town can be had by travelling
down the ladder to the city below.

The Northwestern Watchtower~
~
This particular watchtower stands in the northwestern corner of the
town.  Looking out over the edge shows a long, flat set of plains
which seems to go on for a very long time.  There is really nothing
else to be seen in that direction, except the point where the western
wall meets the northern wall in the very corner of the city.  Looking
back over the city shows a wide array of homes, houses, shops, and
other caves that serve truly unique purposes.  The city looks
absolutely peaceful from here, no disgusting creatures are in sight
walking around the town.  Back inside the tower, four different metal
holders have been placed around the room.  Each one has the job of
holding torches when nighttime comes around.  This is to help the
Creepers who work here to have better views of what is going on around
them.  Also, there is always a minimum of one guard on duty here, so
the Creepers should be more than prepared for any attack upon their
town.

The Northeastern Watchtower~
~
This watchtower stands in the northeastern-most point of the town
of the Creepers.  Looking out over the east, one can see a huge cliff,
on top of which stands a large forest.  To the north, there really
isn't anything important other than the continuous plains that seem to
go on forever.  It appears as though the main way of gaining access to
this town is through the cliff to the east, as a cave has been formed
over the many years.  One can also see a wonderful, peaceful view of
the city by looking over the opposite edge.  There seems to be no
worries and no troubles - just complete peace and harmony.  Four unlit
torches sit in each corner of the room, ready to be lit up the second
darkness approaches this town.  The ladder has been nailed to the
floor, and it serves as the only exit from this tower.

The Creeper Inn~
~
This large cave looks as if it has been planned out very well, with
an actual bench sitting in the corner.  This bench sits across from a
counter which has been built by the Creepers.  The counter goes in a
semi-circle, with each end connected to the wall of the cave.  There
is a section of the counter that can be opened and closed, allowing
access for the Creepers who work there.  To the right of the counter
is a hallway that leads to the back.  It appears as though a stairwell
or staircase lies beyond the hall at the very end.  Peaking over the
counter, one can see a small stool for sitting of the clerk who is
working at the time.  How exactly the Creepers got enough intelligence
to create a working inn is unknown, but they are obviously much more
intelligent than they appear.  There is a fabric that rests over what
serves as the entrance and exit of the inn.  It has been cut in a
fashion so that sunlight can come from the outside into the cave,
shining down on the counter.  What serves as the floor of the cave is
actually dirt and hardened mud, creating a very natural look.  Two
more stools sit beside the bench, offering more room for visitors to
rest their wary legs.

Hallway in the Creeper Inn~
~
This hallway is more like a tunnel in a cave.  The top of the
tunnel is nothing but dirt and rock.  Nothing really catches the
interest here, as it is only used as a way of travelling from the
front desk to the rooms in the inn.  The light from the north seems to
creep into this portion of the hallway, allowing those who lack the
ability to see in darkness to somehow make their way from one end of
the hallway to the other.  Bits of dirt have crumbled off of the sides
of the cave, falling down to form a pile of clay on the ground.  It
appears as though a staircase is to the south, constructed out of
nothing but clay and stone.  How exactly this was created remains
unknown, as it appears as though it could be completely naturally. 
Back to the north lies the front office of the Creeper's Inn, where
one can go to purchase a room key or leave the inn.

Hallway in the Creeper Inn~
~
The hallway comes to a sudden and abrupt end here.  Instead of
moving forward, the only possible exit besides going back is above. 
An actual staircase has somehow been molded or construed from the mud
that makes up this cave.  Each step is about one or two feet from the
last, making the upwards travel a bit tough and difficult.  The light
coming from the north begins to fade out a little bit, but there is
light shining down from above that makes it quite easy to see
everything.  It appears as though the rooms of the inn are below,
although exactly how comfortable and adequate for sleep the rooms are
has yet to be seen.  Most would probably not expect too much out of
the rooms here in the Creeper Inn, as their entire town is pretty much
made out of clay and stone, something most people are not exactly
comfortable with.  The light that comes from above is a bit
mysterious, as well.  Something must be open to the outside upstairs
in the inn to cause this light.

Upstairs Hallway~
~
The staircase leads up to this hallway, which is actually just
another tunnel.  The very top of the cave has a large crack in it,
giving access to the air and sunlight.  This also comes with the fact
that it must be quite dark here in the cave during the night hours of
the day.  The staircase goes down and eventually leads to the lobby of
the Inn.  There are two rooms located in this part of the hallway. 
Somehow the Creepers have managed to construct a wooden door that has
actually been placed into the walls of the cave.  These doors lead to
the rooms of the Inn, and one can make out which key opens which door
by the color code over each wooden door.  The keys can be bought at
the lobby of the Creeper Inn.  The door to the{r west{x has a{r red marking{x
over the top of the entranceway.  There is a{y yellow marking{x over the
top of the{y eastern{x door, showing that the yellow key will unlock that
particular door.  The hallway continues to the south, with two more
rooms to the south.  The staircase leads back down to the hallway on
the first floor, with the exit coming a bit further.  The top of this
part of the cave has a well-sized crack where sunlight can creep in
from the sky.  Other than that, this looks as if it has been kept up
with and taken care of.

End of a Hallway~
~
This part of the cave also branches off into two more rooms.  These
are the last two of the four total rooms in this inn.  Once again,
there are actually wooden doors that have been built into the cave. 
Each one is locked of course, but a key will open it and allow access.
There are colors above each of the two doors that reside here.  There
is a{b blue etching{x on the{b eastern door{x.  Apparently, the room with the{b
blue{x etching is the most elaborate one due to the high price of a key.
There has to be something that makes that room better than the others.
The room to the{g west{x has a{g green marking{x over the top of the door. 
The western room is the second most expensive room in this Inn, so it
probably has something that makes it quite good.  The hallway comes to
an end to the south, but continues to the north.  Two more rooms can
be found to the north as well.  They are the two cheaper ones, but
they serve their purpose just as much as these two.

{yThe Yellow Room{x~

This room is completely covered in a yellow mist it appears.  There
is a twirling whirlpool in the center of the room, with nice, warm
water for resting.  This particular room is quite different from the
types of rooms found in other Inns and hotels.  Instead of a bed, the
only thing used for resting is the large whirlpool.  There is a
crystal that emanates the yellow light near the back of the room, but
the light completely takes over the entire room.  This crystal's light
is obviously a magical gem that gives a soothing, healing aura to
whoever is resting or sleeping in it.  Other rooms lie to the west,
past the door.

This room is covered in a red aura that feels somewhat warm and

which bubbles nonstop.  A crystal emanates a red aura lights up the
cave, bouncing around from one side to the other.  It is very close to
the pool, and it hits the pool at a straight, direct line.  This must
be how the Creepers rest and get healthy quickly.  This individual
room is very inexpensive.  Only the yellow room in the hotel is
cheaper.  One can't help but wonder if all four of the rooms have a
crystal and a pool.  The only way to find out would be to visit each
one individually, but that could cost a fortune.

This room is the second-most expensive room of the Creeper Inn.  An
amazing sight is seen upon the entrance of this room.  Near the back
of the room sits one well-sized crystal.  This crystal completely
lights up the room in a blue aura of warmth and healing.  The crystal
is sitting very near to a whirlpool of sorts that takes up the entire
middle of the room.  The whirlpool has swirls of water than go round
and round in large circles.  The whirlpool looks welcoming for some
reason, as if it will heal wounds of exhausted travellers quicker than
usual.  The door stands on one side of the cave area, leading to the
hallway where one can either leave the Inn altogether or just rest up
in another room of the Creeper Inn.

This room has a strange, green glow that illuminates from a crystal
near the back of the cave.  The first thing to catch one's attention,
aside from the glowing crystal, is the huge whirlpool in the middle of
the room.  Water swirls around in one big continuous circle.  The cave
would be lost in complete darkness were it not for the large crystal
that lets off the soft, green glow that encompasses the room.  This is
the most expensive room available here at the Creeper Inn, and it
might be because the warmth given off by the green aura in the room. 
There is something that gives off a feeling of safety and comfort
rarely found anywhere else.  Apparently, the Creepers use these rooms
to rest their tired or wounded bodies in the whirlpool and allow the
crystal to shine down upon them, healing them in the process.  The
door stands on one side of the room, built into the cave walls.  The
door leads out to the upstairs hallway of the Creepers Inn, where one
can gain access to three other rooms.  Those three rooms are actually
cheaper than this one, but each serves some sort of purpose.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This dwelling is a very large cave compared to the other homes in
this city.  The entrance is covered up by a large piece of fabric,
which stretches from the top of the cave to the bottom.  Just like the
other homes, the cloth has large circles cut out of it which allow
light to shine from the outside of the cave to the inside.  The cave
has two large tables that sit across from each other in the center of
the cave.  One table has miscellaneous tools and objects on it, while
the other apparently has what the Creepers use as plates and eating
utensils sitting atop it.  Each table has a small bench that runs
across it, allowing a place to sit for the Creepers.  Although the
Creepers are completely digusting and horrid in appearance, this race
is somewhat intelligent and knowledgable about the world.  They have
discovered how to create and use many of the same things other, more
advanced races use currently.  The exit to this hut is found to the
south where one will have to go under the cloth to get back into the
city.

A Creeper's Home~

The cave on the opposite side of the street is a bit unusual, but
this one is just normal like the rest, although it is a bit wider than
others.  Two medium-sized benches sit in this cave, one in the front
and one in the very back.  A table also sits in the center of the
room, a couple freshly used pots sitting atop it.  The ground is bare
and looks completely dead.  The brown dirt has been kicked around
plenty of times over the years, and it has managed to form large plots
of sand in certain parts.  There is a very small, worn piece of fabric
over the entrance.  It doesn't come to the ground at all, and falls
very short of it actually.  The exit lies to the west, where one can
find the eastern street of the city which runs north and south.

A Creeper's Home~

This home sits across from another one on the opposite side of the
street.  This dwelling is of average size, yet it is quite unusual
compared to most of the other homes.  There is absolutely no fabric
hanging over the entrance, which almost all caves here have.  There
isn't a cot or anything to sleep on, either.  Instead, there is a very
old, faint crystal which barely shines at all anymore.  It is letting
off a faint, {Ggreen{x glow that can barely be seen.  Also, the table
doesn't have anything to sit on while eating.  This must mean the
Creeper here is very poor, or maybe he just chooses to be different. 
The eastern street of the city lies just outside of this dwelling.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This very small dwelling serves as the home to one individual
Creeper.  He doesn't have anything in here except for rugs. 
Obviously, this particular Creeper feels comfortable having a small
hut with nothing of importance to be found inside.  There are a couple
pots sitting on one of the rugs, which lies in a circular pattern
around the center.  This must be where he eats.  To the left of the
entrance, two rugs on top of each other can be found, with a wrinkled
blanket on top of that.  The male Creeper who lives here must use that
spot for sleeping and resting when tired or exhausted.  A bit of noise
comes from the east, where a street can be found going through the
city.  It leads to many other homes, and also a nice variety of shops.

A Creeper's Home~

This cave dwelling is smaller than most of the others found in the
city.  There is only one cot in the back, and a small, round table
sits in front of it.  There is a single stool beside the table which
is used for sitting while eating.  Other than these three objects,
there is really nothing else at all.  The piece of fabric hangs down
to cover the entrance and exit from light, and unlike others it hasn't
been cut at all.  This makes for a very eerie and dark mood to take
over the dwelling.  There is a bit of traffic to be heard outside, as
the intersection of two streets comes to a point there.

A Creeper's Home~

This cave is an average size, and it really doesn't look that
special on the outside or inside.  There is the normal bench that can
be found in almost all of the homes of the Creepers.  A table sits in
front of the bench, and behind the both of them sits two cots.  Each
cot looks a bit old and used, and nothing really special.  There is
actually one thing that will surprise some.  There is a painting
hanging on the back wall of the cave.  It looks as if it could fall at
anytime, but it is something different from the rest of the caves.  It
is a painting of a pot of flowers, all them are brown and red.  The
flowers truly don't look like they are anything special as a result of
their bland color, but it does create something different that is
usually unseen in this town.  The street lies just to the south, with
the Jewelry & Clothing Store a bit more to the south.

Creeper Clothes & Jewelry~
~
This cave has many wooden pegs that stand up on their base, showing
off clothes that have been hung on them.  There is about a dozen or so
of these wooden pegs, and this creates a very wide array of clothing
choices.  These clothes aren't the average type of clothing, though,
and most outsiders to the town would find them quite strange upon
first look.  After a second look, they start to look decent and maybe
understandable, but they are still nothing to wear back in the bigger
towns and cities of the Realms.  There is also a glass clase which
holds some strange-looking jewelry.  Instead of the usual bright
colors that are used in most jewelry, there is brown and black jewels
that look very rusty and dirty.  Overall, this is the stereotypical
Creeper place - very unique and original, but somewhat strange and
eerie at the same time.  The exit lies to the north, where a soft
piece of fabric hangs over it, dirty and ragged.

A Creeper's Home~

This home is much like the various other caves found in this city. 
There is pretty much nothing new and innovative to be seen here. 
There is a medium-sized table in the center of the room surrounded by
two separate benches, much like the other homes here in the town of
the Creepers.  A couple pots are sitting on top of the table, probably
left over from the previous night.  There are bits and chips that have
been broken off of each pot, making it look like this house would
belong in a very poor part of town back in one of the more popular
cities.  There is also a very bland rug sitting right where the
entrance is, located under the piece of fabric which hangs down from
the entrance.  The rug is quite dirty, which is no big surprise
considering it is sitting on top of clay, rocks, and dirt.  It looks
like it has been stained a reddish brown color.  The Creepers who live
here must just feel blessed to be alive and have such a thing, as they
definitely don't feel the need to keep it clean.  The north and south
street can be seen to the east.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This cave is one of the many that does nothing more than allow a
family of Creepers a place to live.  It is very similar to the many
other houses in the town, which is a bit of a disappointment.  It
seems as though these Creepers really don't try to be too original
when making their houses, or perhaps they didn't really have the
choice.  One must also remember that these caves look completely
natural and that the Creeper probably weren't able to control how they
were built.  The Creepers were probably either total unable to
control, or perhaps not around at the time.  This would be very
strange to see an area of land with many different caves formed out of
almost nothing.  There really is no explanation of how exactly this
place came to be, but it is probably easier to just accept that than
to try to figure everything out.  An exit lies to the west, where one
will find a street through the city.

Entrance to a Tavern~
~
There is actually a small road here that branches off from one of
the main roads in the town.  There is a pretty decent-sized cave to
the east of here, and it looks as though it serves as a place for the
Creepers of the town to go and discuss local occurrences and
happenings.  Apparently, this cave to the east is actually a tavern,
but who knows what kind of drinks are served inside.  People who have
ventured here before would probably stay away from this tavern, as
there can't be anything that is healthy or even good to eat or drink
inside.  Two benches sit on either side of this street, which is a bit
strange to see in such a town.  The main road going north and south
through the town lies to the west, while this tavern is to the east.

The Creeper Tavern~
~
This cave actually looks as if it has been kept up with over the
years.  There are about five circular tables placed randomly
throughout the cave, all made of wood.  Two stools sits beside each
table.  This tavern looks somewhat cozy and offers a place for the
Creepers of the town to come and rest their wounds or just tired bones
and muscles.  Lots of gossip is also shared and traded by the female
Creepers, who are actually more common inside of this tavern than the
male Creepers.  There is a bar in the northern corner of the tavern,
jars sitting atop it.  The Creepers must use jars as drink containers.
This is not too different from the more common races of the Realms. 
One shuold probably be cautious about eating or drinking anything from
this place, as most outsiders do not have the same tastes as the
Creepers.  One can either choose to venture out and try these new
foods and drinks or leave the tavern and search around the mysterious
city even more.  The exit lies just to the west, between two tables
that are surrounded by chairs.

A Small Cave~
~
This cave is quite small compared to most of the others found in
the Creepers' city.  Most people who are of average size or bigger
have to duck down to enter the cave without hitting their heads on the
top.  There are many small, homemade toys scattered throughout this
place.  It looks as though this is just a cave used for playing by the
children Creepers who live in this town.  A couple cribs sit in the
corner, as well.  They are made out of nothing but wood, with a
blanket or two sitting inside of each one, too.  The center of the
cave is completely covered up by the toys.  These toys look like
nothing special, and they actually look quite boring and bland.  The
Creeper children must find some sort of entertainment from them,
though, so they cannot be too bad.  A couple blankets are stacked up
in one corner, and beside them sits a hammock for resting.  Another
thing that is a bit interesting is a manual fan that sits close to the
entrance.  If a Creeper manually turns it, air will be blown out in a
circular motion.  This is a very interesting concept for such a
disgusting and dumb-looking race.  The street running north and south
can be found back outside to the west, under the fabric which is
blowing in the breeze.

Tlorkin's Tools~
~
This cave is an average-sized dwelling area, but it is used as a
shop for tools and other various instruments.  There is a very used
workbench standing near the right side of the room, on which rests
about a dozen various tools of different shapes and sizes.  Blocks of
wood have also been chopped up and left in random places throughout
the cave.  One thing that makes this cave unique from the rest is the
lack of any fabric over the entrance.  Most of the caves here have a
piece of cloth or some other sort of fabric hanging down over the
entrance, but there is absolutely nothing over the entrance of this
cave.  The dirt here on the ground is just the same as that found in
other caves - brown, red, and quite bland.  There is a small stool
sitting beside the workbench, offering the Creeper who works here a
place to sit when using his tools to make or create something new and
inventive.  These Creepers are definitely inventive, too.  Just
searching and adventuring around the city will show any outsiders a
wide array of different things most advanced races have yet to think
of.  There is a road that lies outside to the west of this cave,
various tools placed randomly around that part of the street.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This house, although it has become the normal thing to see, is just
like the others.  There is absolutely nothing special or interesting
about this house.  The regular table sits in the middle of the room,
although this one is a bit misplaced and not truly centered.  A bench
for sitting sits beside the table, allowing Creepers to sit down and
eat their food.  The light from the outside shines down on pots that
sit on the table.  Some pots have also fallen down to break on the
tough, hard clay that makes up the ground.  A street lies to the west
of here.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This dwelling serves to house a number of Creepers.  This is proved
by the eight cots to be found in this cave.  This is quite strange and
hard to imagine since this cave is not that big compared to some of
the others found here in the Creeper's city.  Perhaps not all of the
eight cots are used at once, and maybe some of them have just been
placed here for some odd reason.  There is also a large table that
takes up almost the entire cave, leaving only a bit of room to walk
around to get to the back of the dwelling.  This particular cave looks
extremely messy and trashy, too, as if no one has even attempted to
take care of it or clean it up in ages.  Clay pots and dishes have
been left all around, from the table to the hard, rocky floor the
table rests on.  Two sitting benches sit on either side of the table,
but they are also completely trashed with garbage and old food.  The
only escape from this mess is to the west, which leads back to the
street.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This cave is a very decent-looking home, compared to how most of
the Creepers live.  It appears as though it has been kept up with and
kept clean, something rarely seen in this town.  Three cots sit in the
very back, showing that there must be three Creepers altogether who
live here.  Two of the cots are average in size, while the third and
middle one is much smaller.  This must be a cot for an adolescent
Creeper.  There is the often-seen fabric hanging over the entrance, as
well.  A nice, wooden table sits in the middle of the room.  Three
wooden stools surround it, and once again the middle one is a bit
smaller the the other two.  This must be the child's stool.  A couple
of tools sit very close to the entrance.  They don't really look too
useful, but someone has to find a purpose in their existence.  They
were probably purchased at a Tool Shop, which can be found off of the
street outside.  The top of this cave has bits of dirt that crumble
almost all the time, falling softly onto the table, cots, or ground
where it belongs.  The road outside can be found by exitting to the
east.

A Creeper's Home~
~
This cave looks quite normal on the outside, but the inside shows a
very large dwelling.  There is a ladder leading down into the cave
even more, where it gets a bit darker and more mysterious.  This
appears to be the main room, as there is a couple of toys or tools
sitting around the eating table.  Instead of the regular bench, this
home actually has five individual stools for sitting and resting on. 
The sheet of cloth hanging over the entrance is a nice green color,
and it looks a bit more welcoming than most of the others.  One can
either go down the small ladder to another section of this house or
travel back to the outside and onto the street by going east.
