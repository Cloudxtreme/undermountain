A drow darker than most stands hidden in hsi cloak.  Upon his cloak
there are several spiders some large enough to eat a small human.  A
single lock of grey hair flows out of the robe but mainly you focus
upon his eyes ...  His grey hallow eyes.

The wall is covered in {8d{bark {8s{bhadows{9 of unknown figures.

The wall almost comes alive with the dancing of faint and undistinguishable figures.
They dark in and out at all angles, and without purpose. They seem to melt into the wall
and floor as they might be surrounding you.

A small man stands here trying to greet anyone that would come to this house.
~
The man that stands before you seems like a strong voice of reason. His words are simple
and are intended for all that would visit his house. He warns of danger and of his own
personal loss, yet for some reason he spends his days very near to the house. You get 
the feeling that there may be something off about the frail human as you see gold and
jewels in much of the man's clothing, he might even have your grandmother stuffed into 
a tall bag for all you can tell.

A wealthy man dressed in a finely tailored suit stands here.
~
A man with a purpose and a fine suit looks over the room.
He is of average height and build but exudes a filth of a
very wealthy person. His clothes seem out of fashion from 
a time long ago. A suit with no armor and no weapons to be
seen. His confidence and wealth far surpass his strength and that  
is the only reason he is still alive here ... everyone wants 
something from Fredrick Leron.

Main Hall~
~
The fire place still rests to the east whit the coffin
west.  Also before you are some stairs leading up and some
rafters above. The tile floor ends in this room transising into
a red carpet. The marble walls around you give off a timlessly 
fridged chill that freezes your very soul.

The red carpet stair reach up into the heavens of the house.
The golden mirror at the top of the stairs seems to be the focus of
the only holy potential inside this house. The top of the stairs
branch to the east and west without being able to tel what lies

A Well Furnished Bedroom~

This room reflects the grandure and lusture that this converted
hell of a place the house was intended to be. The gold and red
trim fill you with a deep passion to stay, to rest, to let the
house consume you in its beauty. This feeling causes alarms to
echo through your mind ... there is something not right ...
not with this room, and especially not with this house.

The cloud of smoke and miscellaneous powder that fills the air is strong 
enough to make your nose bleed.  There are plants of different colors and
the walls dance under rhythmic music that pumps though your senses. The 
dealer behind the counter seems to be counting money.  If this was not

As you run through the Basement a cold shriek follows you through
the darkness, or maybe it's the darkness itself.  Your only hope and

should have done.

{WS{8piders and snakes slither around your ankles with a strange black
cabinet on both sides of a glass counter.  The counter is shattered
with webs leakign out of every crack.  Behind this counter you
surprisingly see someone waiting to take your money for goods.  Behind
him is a stock room with potions and other disturbng goods.  A little
trap door sits on the floor and you wonder how many other secrets are
around

The Drive up to THE HOUSE~
~
You stand in a long driveway leading up to The House the Sun dimms
as you neer the House and the creeping vines creep a little closer ...
Your sanity although close before slips away slowly...  You regain it
again and continue up the drive to your stay and the estate of Lord
Nisstyre.  His warmth is no where to be seen in this ...  This
monstrousaty that stands before you ....

leave.
