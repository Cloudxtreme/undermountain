The road north is dusty and humid from past rains, the slight muddyness
of the road creates a dismal air to the road, which is pinned between the
Istar Coast and the Mirkwood Forest.  The slight chirping of crickets stops
abruptly as you proceed by, and with that, the terrain becomes deathly
quiet.  Even the coasts itself, seem to make no noise as you walk the path

As the road begins to pin into the Mirkwood, you begin to hear the sounds
of nature fill your ears.  But the sounds are like most other forests, they
are stranger...  More alien than most other forest they are stranger... 
More alien than most other forest creatures, you can hear them shuffle
across the forest floor.  It's almost like you are being watched....

Deep inside the Mirkwoods, there is a humid mist that seeps along the
ground here, covering the entire floor as far as you can see.  It's too
thick to see through, and seems to hug at your legs, not moving for any
reason.  Hopefully, you won't step on anything too dangerous.

stream flows swiftly despite its small size, and the peaceful, calming sound
it makes, paired with the chirping of birds in the nearby forest, makes for
a nice promenade.

Approaching Lucullus~
~
As you travel along the dirt road, you approach a small hamlet.  A small
village of fishers and hunters.  The smell of cooking meat and drying fish
fill your nostrils.  A very sequestered village, kept alive only with the
travel of caravans every now and again.

Town of Lucullus~
~
A signpost piked into the ground points the directions and distances to
different possibile locations.  The closest one indicates the town,
{^Lucullus{x which you are in the presence of.  The small town is fenced
only by sporadic haystacks and livestock fences, yet has a feeling of
pleasant cozyness around it.  Children laugh and play in the nearby feilds,
obilivious to the world.  To the west, a quaint stable has taken its stake
on the land.

Town of Lucullus~

The peasants of the village seem to live a rather busy lifestyle despite
the small community itself.  There is laughter and song coming from the
east, where the tavern and inn dubbed {^The Laughing Lass{x is established,
and the West has A Temple devoted to Chauntea.

Center of Lucullus~
~
As you walk along the road traversing the town, a house that looks larger
and stylish compared to the others sits on the west.  Perhaps the Town hall?
Opposite the Town hall, is advertized to be a general store by a sign
hanging above the door.  The people here hustle along with daily life, and
nod in notice to your presence.

Town of Lucullus~
~
This end of town is ripe with activity.  There seem to be a few merchant
caravans stopping here to trade with the local blacksmiths and weapon
makers.  The modest shop to the west has it's doors opened to all those who
would enter.  Further northwest, you can see what seems to be the division
of the lands, marked by the patrol units of the Realms of Vector.

Outskirts of Lucullus~
~
On the outskirts of the town of "{^Lucullus{x", the sounds of life throw
a mirror compared to the empty feelings of the endless road.  The north
holds activity, not pesantry activity like the town, but a more sinister
one.  The borderline of Vector lies northwest.

The Road To Vector~

Nothing but the blowing wind and the reed-like rattleing of the grass are
audible.  The dusty road leaves a brown film on your shoes as you travel. 
The dust disturbed by your feet is quickly carried into the crosswind,

The Road To Vector~

The final point before the Checkpoint to Vector holds an ominous
ambience.  Armed border patrols mark recent conflict, betrayal, and hate. 
Cautious Guards throw a careful sneer at your approach, they seem to murmmer
between each other about somthing.  A few steps north will lead you out of
the Tri Power Lands and into uncertainty.

grass and ocean to the next.  Though, in the far east distance, there are
structures marking the evidence of civilization.  St.  Plattsburg is to
