Two guards stand on either side of the gate, tense and ready for

the closed gates, large crowds moving about, action, and adventure.
Makou City, home of "Makou Reactor Zero", the original Makou Reactor.
This once small underground mining town slowly thrived, until its
key location was picked for testing the new Makou Reactors.  A
contract signed with the city allowed the Tripower to work in the area
for ten years.  Afterwards the city would revert to its previous
government.  Tens years past, and Makou City became the first non-
Tripower government to own a Makou Reactor.

Throughout the room there are many known outlaws and citizens from the
other side of town.  This tavern is the main meeting place of many
outlaws of the area.  In different corners there are groups gambling,
or shady dealings happening before your eyes.  There are even women
gesturing to men and up the staircase.  A Sturdy barkeep stands behind
the counter serving one and all any drink he can provide.

{WA plain table rests in the center of this room, surrounded by many
chairs, some of which lie broken.  Along a wall hangs a horribly
tattered scroll, surrounded by a tremendous bloodstain.  Their lie
many carvings in the table, the ground around it looking halfheartedly
swept.  This is where the organized of this town used to meet, and
congregate.  Now, only the remnants lie scattered around.  The room
has obviously not been used in a very long time.

A Tattered scroll reads: Rules Governing this meeting and citizens of this city...
 
Staring hard at the scroll for awhile you give up in frustration, only being able to decipher letters or a number here and there through the bloodstains and rips.

the pub by contacts he met while out and about in the world.  Everyone
he's hired here have been people he's met in some way somewhere else.
And while most bars disuade their customers from starting bar fights,
BackStab almost encourages it.  Of course, the healing magics used here
are second to (almost) none.

The cobble stone road leads south from the hamlet of Twin Corners
across the Torregiano Plains, crossing a shallow canyon and into the
side of a volcano.  The road itself is big enough for two airships and
foot traffic.  On either side of the road are the grassy flatlands of
the plains.

A massive tunnel runs away from Makou City to the south, north out
the northern face of the volcano.  The tunnel itself is large enough
for two large airships to pass side by side with enough clearance, and
for even walking traffic to creep along the sides.  Large gas lanterns
hang on either side of the tunnel walls.  Above massive pipes run out
of the ceilings, smaller ones connecting off running to the lanterns. 
Steam and other gases hiss from the pipes of Makou Zero above.

{*  The city of Makou ends with a giant tunnel leading north, big enough
for two large airships to pass safely inside.  The tunnel itself glows
green from the gas lights inside.  To the west another tunnel curves
around leading upwards, a sign points out the name Makou Zero.  To the
east another tunnel curves away leading downwards, a sign pointing out
the name Port Makou. Southwards is Makou City itself.{x

  {*The wrought iron fence is here to stop anyone from entering the
facility just down this massive cavern tunnel.  Makou Zero is the
birthplace of Makou Technology, the first reactor to go online, and
the first to be owned by another nation other than the Tripower.  Now
owned by the Makou City Government, a union of leaders whom run this
city, it remains generating to this day.  Unlike the Reactors of
Torregiano and other cities, the pressure boilers that compress the
lifestream into a gas are powered by coal, creating high heat and
heavy smoke.  The Gates appeared to be locked.{x
 
{*  (OOC) This area has been left unoverhauled compared to that of
Makou City itself.  A few minor changes and colored room names have
been added, but the rest, including the typo of our original spelling,
Mako, remain.  Welcome to the first Makou Reactor.{x

Inside this small building appears several large isles filled with
foods and other supplies.  Amounst the shelves are canteens of water,
bottles of beer, potions, wands, small daggers and assorted tools. 
Barrels line the wall filled with grains and other food stalk, along
with giant bins of vegitables and potatos.  In other bins filled with
ice, fresh fruit slowly ripens under the makou gas lanterns.  The
shopkeeper behind his small counter next to the only exit keeps a
watchful eye over all who enter his store.
