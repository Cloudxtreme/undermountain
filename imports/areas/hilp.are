Before the West Gates of a Village~
~
You are now standing outside the gates on what is known as a village of
sort.  The structure outside is layered with fine bricks and the village
seems to be newly built and magnificent in its presence.  Tall flags stand
high on the high towers to your left and right with several guards perched
high on the lookout for any signs of war.  A trail leads away from the
village to the west, while the gates prevent your way in to the east.

hard brick surface allowing those to move about easily into the village. 
Huge gates are standing to your west that lead itself out of town.  A dead
end can be seen distantly to your east as the path takes you deeper in this

a clean cut shrubs of clovers turning to the west ahead where you see huge
trees slowly approaching.  To the north, the path makes a steady climb where
beyond, a faint structure of sorts can be seen.  A small centipede walks by
you and almost gets smushed..  Good job.  The trail twists sharply to the

studying it.  Festive decorations furnish around this square giving a sense
of excitement and fun to those travelling from afar.  A path veers to the
north and south from here while high spirits can be heard to the west.

sure to keep a green-footed adventurer well prepared for the simplest

counter busying himself with a rag and some spit, shining up a piece
of armor.  He looks up briefly to smile, and continues his work, but
certainly is glad to have any business he can find.

You stumble across an empty, quiet lot just north of the bustling
city square.  The grass grows tall here and all about you are remnants
of trash and debris that once served, or continue to serve as
makeshift toys for the village children.  For some reason, this place
seems calm and serene.

Inside the Eastern Gates~

Welcome to the unknown village!  It seems that alot of activity seems to
be brewing as you enter the village.  Many travellers come from distant
lands in hopes of purchasing unique items sold here or to visit those that
dwell in this establishment.  The ground beneath you is well layered with a
hard brick surface allowing those to move about easily into the village. 
Huge gates are standing to your east that lead itself out of town.  A dead
end can be seen distantly to your west as the path takes you deeper in this
animated village.

You are now standing outside the gates on what is known as a village of
sort.  The structure outside is layered with fine bricks and the village
seems to be newly built and magnificent in its presence.  Tall flags stand
high on the high towers to your left and right with several guards perched
high on the lookout for any signs of war.  A trail leads away from the
village to the east, while the gates prevent your way in to the west.

buildings stretch across the northern lots.

Southwest Main Street~
~
This street is well traveled, as the bricks are smooth and clean
from many years of wear.  Modest buildings line either side, far away
from the main street with grass lined paths going two and fro.  The
air is fresh and crisp and filled with the aroma of good smelling
foods.  The main street curves to the south here, and continues onward
to the east.
