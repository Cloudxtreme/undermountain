of thunder can be heard in the distance.  Regardless of the storm,
people bustle about their business, trading, bartering, and carrying
out their lives.  No one in this city seem to be affected by the state
of the weather, as if it's a natural setting.  The city itself looms
before you, and seems to expand before your very eyes.  Most of the
buildings are constructed from a beautiful green stone, and the
streets are of a fine cobble.  A very important looking building
towers over the rest of the city to the northeast.  From here roads
lead north, east, and west.

The alley comes to a sudden end here, and stops before a few large
buildings.  The intricate green stone walls of these buildings are almost
hypnotizing as you stand in awe before them.  There's something about the

You have entered a once beautiful building, now overrun with plant
life.  The eastern wall is completely broken through, where tree limbs
