A short, stumpy man is leaning on his spear, keeping watch.
~
He isn't much to look at, this bloke, but he's got a mean glint in
his mud brown eyes when he's crossed.  Only a few inches above five
feet, he has a rather rotund belly that must contain more than a few
spare beers.  His thinning hair is a dirty blonde that is poorly
attended to.  He wears a chain shirt over an almond colored tunic and
a pair of too-tight leather breeches.

There is little to be said about this creature; the entirety of it
is a giant mass of translucent green slime.  When it shifts out of its
round, blob shape, little bits of slime drip, and a thin trail of ooze
is left in its wake when it moves.  It gives off an acrid scent.

In better times, she would be every bit the socialite.  Her grey
hair is piled atop her head in ringlets and her dress is crisp and
clean.  Powder and makeup accent her features, fading the lines of age
that dart across her face, and there is an air of sophistication about
her, even now.  However, she looks slightly pale, and through her
makeup dark bags can be seen under her eyes.

The only distinguishing feature of this man is that he is tall. 
His head is covered with a black mask that only has holes for his eyes
and mouth, both hidden with shadow.  His lanky figure is dressed in
similarly bland black clothes, though his sword belt has silver
markings on it. He looks like a whole lot of trouble.

cheekbones high and chiseled, cheeks painted with the lightest touch
of rouge.  Falling in crinkled waves, her rich brown hair is kept back
from her face with a pair of braids, each accented with a weave of
golden ribbons.  She wears a tight fitting dress, gold in color, and a

There isn't much that calls attention to this average man.  He

facial hair.  Crisp and clean, his green tunic matches his eyes,
sleeveless and fitting snug to his scrawny chest.  The leather
breeches he wears are equally well kept, though they are loose,
covering the tops of his well worn boots. Large bags hang
under his eyes.

Misfits of the Realms~

Plain white, the hallway itself is simplistic.  Lit from overhead,
there are few shadows, and each door is alike.  At the end a small
table stands against the wall with nothing on it.  Strange sounds
break through the silence, a cacophony of noise.  To the north, a sign
on the door reads "Treant" and to the south one reads "Roper."

Treant Room~
~
This bare room has walls the color of dust and blood, though near
the ceiling it can be seen that once they were white.  A large cage
takes up most of the room, its bars solid and close together; there is
only a few feet at the front in which to stand.  Barred well, a door
opens into the cage, its floor littered with food, among other things.

Sixth Floor Lobby~
~
There is a different feel to this level of the museum.  The lobby
is similar to the rest, a plain room, though this one boasts a small
table with a light set upon it.  Noises fill the air, though they are
unlike the animal cries of many of the lower floors.

This hallway leads the length of the building and is plain, with
white walls.  It is the air that sets it apart; it is filled with a
strange smell compared to the rest.  The sounds of this floor are
different as well, some sounding a good deal like speech.  To the
north a sign on the door reads "Dryad" and to the south one reads
"Vargouille."
