felt in this section of the city than in any other.  The citizens are
dressed more finely than in other parts of the city.  It is apparent
why this district is considered the jewel of St.  Plattsburg.

Entering this part of the city, the smell of salt water in the air
becomes very strong.  Looking south from this square, glimpses of the
ocean can be seen through the buildings.  Travelling east or west will
take you along the street that travels along this bay in the Sea of
Istar.  In the center of the square is a signpost which tells of the
main attractions in this district.

Walking along, a dock can be seen to the south.  A sign near the
dock reads, 'Dock #2.  ' To the north is a steam factory.  Large
amounts of people are running around working as hard and fast as
possible.  A large Vectorian cargo ship can be seen to the south
unloading it's precious cargo.  The smell of coal burns the eyes and
the lungs of the fresh sailors exiting the ship.

The bustle of dockworkers running around attempting to unload the
ship's cargo as fast as possible is confusing.  They are screaming
back and forth directions and instructions for unloading the cargo and
where to place it.  Sailors are coming in waves heading the opposite
direction trying to get as far away as possible.  The soot has become
thicker than before the the smell of burning coal is harsh.

Fisherman and prostitutes hang around the old shop to the south. 
It is an old meeting place for both professions.  The smell of coal
and the soot is thick in the air.  Trash is littered upon the street
as well as drunken sailors.  Girls and sailors hustle to the nearest
Inn while fisherman tell tall tales of past glory.

Along this street are many docks.  Sailors and dock workers hustle
around to finish their jobs and begin the next.  The street is wet
from being sprayed cleaned.  Fishermen roam the docks trying to find
where the fish are today while prostitutes roam the docks trying to
make a living.  The seagulls scavenge about looking for a dropped fish
or an unattended bait buck.

West Bay continues east and west.  The smoke stakes from the factory

Seagulls roam the street in packs towards the end of Bay street. 
Angry fisherman come here to try and cut down the growing number of
seagulls.  Few dockworkers are seen about while even fewer sailors are
seen.  The air is a mix of the sea and the steam factory.  As the wind
shifts either the sea of the coal smell becomes stronger.

The large bay wall can be seen from here.  Standing proudly and
keeping the town safe from intruders from the sea.  The hustle and
bustle of bay street has finally come to an end for the most part. 
The smell of the steam factory is barley noticeable and the fisherman
have free reign on the pier.  The seagulls still give them hell
though.  But that is one of the best fishing spots in all of St.

This wall is well constructed.  Granite boulders hauled from the
nearby hills have been fused together by the working of the wizards of
the Empire.  The wall itself is sturdy and unphased by the lashing
from the sea.

The ground is blackened by a fire that once engulfed the warehouse.
The wooden planks that make up the walls are half burned to the
ground.  Large gaps in the roofing allow a clear view of the sky

warehouse, their contents ruined.

To the north is Durien Street and through the square to the south
it continues.  The street is crumbling and cracked everywhere.  Dirt
and grim rests on the street in layers.  The smell here is quite
perplexing.  A combination of the factory and the worker's housing
complex makes for quite a powerful yet distinct smell.  The smoke
stacks from the factory are well seen from here as they pump black
smoke into the air.

Durien Street rests to the south and continues through the square
to the north.  The ocean breeze blows through here attempting to move
the stagnant foul air out of the square but to no avail.  Sailors and

trade.  From here to the eastern area of the square is reserved for
them and their services with the larger inn be so close.

house on the outside was only an illusion, but the house seems to be
untouched by thieves.  The chandelier was made of fine crystals, some
of which are on the floor and still in good shape.  Since this was the
source of light when it worked, you wonder what causes the light in
here now...

to rest here.  Six mammoth tress rest across each other in a star

will pay the price.  The sailors rushing from their recently docked
ships wave fists full of Vectorian currency in the direction of

The graffiti continues along the wall.  Some looks like the ranting
of a mad man while the other is obviously from the local resistance. 
The streets condition is no better than the rest of the street. 
Though it does smell as if the entire cities population of drunks uses
it as a restroom.

A long wall runs along the western side of the street inclosing the
steam factory.  The street is covered in trash, silt and debris.  The
smell in the air chokes the tourists to tears.  The walls are covered
in graffiti and silt from the coal used in the steam factory.

To the north is Commerce Street and following Durien street to the
south you will find Victory Square and the docks at the end of this
street.  The street is quite long but not very wide, it has issues
like much of the city but is obviously nothing to brag about.  Weeds
grow up from the cracks within it and a foul smell is carried upon the
wind from the west.  The street lamp here appears to have been ripped
from it's place of rest and is no longer here period.

The smell coming from the west is almost overpowering.  It smells
of garbage and mold.  The street is so cracked that entire spots have
crumbled into the earth and are now puddles of mud and broken up
stone.  The wall begins again on the east side of the street and is in
slightly worse shape than to the south.  The alleyway to the west is
dark and uninviting to those of heavy pockets.

At this corner Onyx intersects W.  Victory Way which continues to
the east.  The smell of the factory out weights the smell of the sea
now.  The seagulls no longer hover above in the sky.  The street is
well worn here from sailors, prostitutes and guards attempting to keep
the unlawful in line.  To the north is the slum district within St. 
Plattsburg.  Many criminals and vagrants roam this area.

to the building to the east.  A patrol office resides here.  With the
increasing amount of vagrants and criminal activity within this
district it was necessary to have additional enforcement present.  The
street here is in no better repair than in any other section in the

knee high on an average human.  The stench of death is strong and
there is little wind to lessen the smell.  Carcasses of dead rats and

This corner of the square is filled with old newspapers and other
trash for which the homeless use to wipe the themselves.  The smell is
quite foul and pungent.  Not enough the thralls will clean this
section of the square.  There are markings on the crumbling wall that
indicate the last time the square housed a champion and a parade.

monument to hidden forces and the bleak urbane.  The solid wall is

barnyard stock, can be seen to the east and south.  There is nothing

This is the center of St. Plattsburg, Vector's great harbor city. 
Foosteps clatter on the brown cobblestones as pedestrians head in
every direction; many seem to be drawn to the salty breeze and aroma
of fish which waft in from the south. Others, particularly those
dirtiest vagrants who make up the majority of the throng, disperse
into the nearby slums and alleys. Looming over the square is a giant

here is in horrible shape.  Large patches of grass grow outta of what
is left of the cobblestone street.  Through the years and the high

has been demolished under the feet of the residents and tourist.

The center of the square was once a magnificent place where
celebrations in the name of a Vector Victory were held.  Champions of
war were held in high regard and parades and festivals were held here
in the glory days of Vector.  There was once a contest of sorts to see
who was the greatest champion of Vector every ten years.  The winner
would have a statue of his or her likeness erected in the middle of
the square.  Though those days are over a statue of the last champion
still rests here decaying slowing.

A large iron gate rises above most, some sort of mechanism withen
the city walls, ready to drop the gate at the first sign of danger. 
The area beneath the gates seem to resemble a tunnel.  A large oaken
door is built into the wester wall.  The sounds of the busy market
seem to loom in from the south.

Here stand the gates of the largest city withen the Vectorian

senses.  The towers positioned at various points upon the walls
surrounding this city are well placed, helping to thwart any troulbes
that may find this city.  A brick path leads south through the gates.

The road begins to slope downward, suddenly giving way to a
beautiful panoramic view of the bay. The dirty smells and indigent
masses are left behind as Waterward Avenue enters the wealthier Bay
District. Clothes still hang from wires, strung across alleys and
between second-story windows above the street, but the clothes here
are nicer, and the buildings are clean and stately. The faint sound
of care-free laughter drifts in on a fresh sea breeze, and you breathe

and those willing to sell pleasures of the flesh.  Drunks and the

bathrooms.  It is in ill repair and nothing is left of the glory days
but a crumbling statue that rests in the middle of the square.

A large wall runs along the both sides of the street all the way to
Victory Square.  A few patrolmen roam the street but otherwise it is
vacant.  Large smoke stacks from the factory cast a shadow onto the
street.  The noise from the factory is loud enough to drown out even
the sound of footsteps upon the cobble stone street.  Silt rests heavy
upon the street and tops of the walls and is pungent within the air. 
The street appears to get cleaned but not regularly.

cobblestones end within feet of the alley's beginning.  To the east is
a house that appears to be in less than favorable repair. 
Questionable people walk onto and out of the alley in scattered
numbers.  A few seagulls and rats scavenge the piles of trash and
rotten food in search of a meal.

The alley turns here to the north and continues to the east.  The
ground here is well trample and muddy.  Trash is sparse and so are the
rats.  Drunks and filthy people walk about going about their business.
Drunk and filthly people roam about coming and going.  A small house
is visible to the south.  Broken crates rest against the small
crumbling walls of the alley.

The smell of ash is heavy in the air.  The ground is marred with
deep footprints and is rather muddy.  To the north you see a burned
down house and a few beggars walking around eyeing the remains of the
house.  The soot and mud have mixed together to make a layered pattern
of mud and ash within the ground.

The alley begins where Onyx Street branches off to the east.  The
muggy air is filled with the smell of molding garbage.  Large rats run
about carrying off anything that will make good nest material.  The
wet ground is clear of most trash, just a few scraps of paper soaked
from laying on the ground.

This once livable house is now filled floor to ceiling with trash. 
There are numerous stacks of trash organized by material type.  A pile
of rusted and degraded metals fill one corner of the house, while
stacks of rotting wooden planks lie atop each other according to
length.  Papers stuffed and squeezed into paper bags.  The smell of
rotting wet wood and paper feels the moist air.

The smell of mold hangs heavy on the muggy air.  Small vines grow
from the ground and cling to the alley walls.  Small patched of moss
grow off of the few stones that are sunk within the ground.  Scraps of
paper lay restless on the wind sweeped ground.  Small wind devils form
in the corner of the alley picking up small pieces of trash and
causing them to spin within it.  The house to the east is covered in
vines and thickets.

This corner of the alley leads to the east.  The air is stale and
thick here.  A large vines covers the interior of the corner wall from
the ground up and over it's height.  Bugs crawl amongst the vines

The grounds is wet and swirls of red show up at the surface.  Rust
from the shack to the north mixes with the runoff and pools in the
alley.  Bits of broken glass stick out of the ground and reflect what
light they can.  The mud is well worn and sloppy from the mud.

The alley begins where Durien Street branches off to the west.  It
is dark and the air is muggy.  Trash and bottles line the outside
edges of the alley.  The ground is made up of loose stones scattered
about sinking into the wet ground.  Small bugs and large rodents crawl
and scurry about the ground within the shadows of the alley.  To the
south there is a rundown shell of a house.

The sheet metal that composes the walls is rusted and pitted. 
Small holes let in small rays of light into the hot air.  The ground
serves as the floor and it is dry yet soft.  The tin roof panels being
to vibrate then rumble with a strong gust of wind.  And when it passes
the tin panels begin to settle once again.  The room is dark and the
air is hot and thick.

The room is quite small and crowded.  The husky cadets take up alot
of space standing against the wall.  The walls are covered with Vector
posters promoting the Vector Empire.  The floors are wooden and show
quite abit of wear on them.  Where the wall is visible the paint chips
and flakes onto the floor.  A large man stands behind a wooden desk
looking over paperwork.

The windows are all broken and the broken pieces of glass litter
the floor.  The floor is in decent shape while the walls are covered
in holes and graffiti.  The ceiling has very few holes that are no
bigger than a human fist.  The graffiti wraps around the walls in a
display of art as in a gallery.  Empty paint cans lie in piles in the
middle of the room.

The ground is soft and wet with small pools of stagnant water
littering the grounds.  Trash is blown across the empty lot and the
top and bottoms of bottles stick out of the ground reflecting the
light from the moon.  Insects come and go from the stagnant pools
flying in and out of the light.

The inside is as bad as the outside.  Vines entangle the floors and
walls, as moss and fungi inhabit the cracks along the outside edges of
the walls.  The walls seem to be held together by the foliage.  The
floor is missing large gaps of space from were rotten and decaying
wood once was.

The place is very foul smelling upon entering it.  No furniture of
any sorts is within this house.  Blankets and newspaper lay restless
upon the drafty floor.  The roof has leaks and the floor has buckets
to catch the leaks.  Though the walls are splitting and have come out
of square.  People still use it as a temporary home.
