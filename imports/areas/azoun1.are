strange stone tablet altar~
On the eve of the fall of mortals, there came a plea from the ancient gods that their
sport be spared...of the mortal lives, death was upgraded to life, but life without
enduring faith...and of the immortal gods, theirs was the ultimate price: to forever
endure longevity but in mortal shells.  The hierarchy of the Olympus gods befell the
obscurity of myth and legend...their thrones vanquished to the Greater Realms...their
invincibility and omnipotence shedded for the feeling and emotion they so revered, and
among us they live...gods only in their ancestry.
{x
The patrons of Olympus live among mortals as one of them, but taken from them was not
their gift of insight and craft.  Of craft there was one unlike any others, the smith's
trade to forge one final relic bestowed once upon the woman who would have seen the
end of the world forever: the weapon known as Hopebringer.
{x
Hopebringer can be forged still in these twilight hours, but greatly lacking in the
magnificence it once beheld.  Its creator was, is and can only be the smith of Olympus.
Once discovered and petitioned for his favor, the smith may offer the secret to his
craft: the items necessary to forge Hopebringer.  If offered to him an arrow from the
bow of Eros, then perhaps the gruff purveyor of immortal craft would be willing to
share his gift with others.

Tomb of Asundral~

{&As you enter into the giant chamber the cave opens up into a 
large vault.  The smell is that of old parchments and small 
dead rodents.  {7Pale {&stagalmites give off the only light.  You
cannot see the roof for the light doesn't extend far enough.  
About thirty-five feet inwards, you notice a large {8stone{& box 
inlined with thousands of runes created with a time long before 
yours.  All around the tomb there are golden trinkets and valued 
items of whoever rests inside the crypt.  As you near the tomb 
itself you notice that there is one message that everyone can 
read.  It is illuminated in a {3g{8l{3o{8o{3m{8y {&irridesence, and says this 'Here 
Lay Asundral, Pillager of all!'{x

grows all around you.  In the distance to the east you can
see the mountains.  To the west looms CandleKeep, the north
beholds the Friendly Arm Inn, and to the south lies Bergost.

Upon looking down from the ledge, it is discernable that to fall would
certainly be death.  Jagged rocks pount out at frequent intervals. 
The height of the fall itself would be difficult for a simple mortal
to survive.  The uneven mountain floor below would not lend any
comfort to the whole ordeal.  {x

{7Down to the Valley~

{7The cliff wall comes back down to the path, and then hits a
switchback.  The terrain is easy to travel, and is mostly just gravel.
Ocasional tuffs of grass have sprouted up through the areas of loose
rock, althought these small patches do not appear to be in the best of
condition.  They are plauged with discoloration, from lack of water. 
The trail then leads to slope down to the South.  {x

the Western peak of the Valley.  As you descend deeper into the
Valley, more vegitation sprouts up.  Trees and shrubs are more common,
There is also an increase in humidity, Unlike the barren mountains, a
sweet smell of life whispers through the air.  A slight trickle
of water can be heard from the East.  {x

North there is a large rock, easily mistaken for a mountain.  The
temperature is cool, and the sun hits the foilage creating lots of
shade.  A small {^stream{7 trickles, and runs off to the east.  The ground
is well worn, made up mostly of dirt, with rocks, and boulders jutting
out irregularily.  {x

on your south side.  The path through the trees seem worn in from use.
There are strange markings on one of the trees.  It is the sign of a
Ranger.  A sweet breeze stirs the leaves on the ground, and causes the
tall grass to sway.  {x

grove of trees have rooted themselves tightly in the small area. 
Shortly to the SouthWest, there is a small creek.  It is that very
creek which gives life to the whole valley.  It is possible to
navigate through the trees either to the South, or to the West.  {x

it is very damp.  Because of the large trees, and other foilage, the
rock is very damp, and in most places is covered in moss.  The shallow
{^creek{7 that comes in from the North, swings West, while continuing its
path South.  The {^creek{7 appears to contain very clean water.  A
refreshing site for the weary traveller.  Remains of past camps can be
seen on the valley floor.  Old fire pits, and cleared areas for
bedrolls mark this as a popular spot.  {x

the backside of the fireplace, a hot-plate, and kettle rack have

A few pots and pans are hung on the wall, wooden cupboards are 
hung on the opposite wall of the pots.  This room is illuminated
