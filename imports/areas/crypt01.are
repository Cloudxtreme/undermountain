during creation you might have more or less spell groups and spells. Type

To advance in levels you will have to gain experience. Each level you 
will need the same amount of experience to advance, but it will become 
harder to get it. The way to gain experience is fighting mobiles. There 
are both mobiles to fight and mobiles that help you with healing for 
example. Type the following to read the directions chapter of this guide:

-[{CHEALING & MAGICAL PROTECTION{x]-
 
Of course after a long fight you will need to heal and rest. So there 
are several places where you can heal in these realms. A well known place
is the Healing Wound Inn. This place can be found South East of Westbridge
recall (see {GREAD DIRECTIONS{x and {YHELP RECALL{x for more information  about 
{GRECALL{x). You can {Grest{x or {Gsleep{x in the Jacuzzi there. ({YHELP SLEEP{x) The 
healer there also provides certain spells. Some of them are free, and will 
be casted by him from time to time. Others cost money, type {GHEAL{x for a list.
 
A very important spell is Sanctuary. This spell will surround you like 
a magical shield and absorb 1/2 of the damage dealt to you. Sometimes 
the healer in the Inn casts it on you for free, but you can also get it 
in the Church with the {GCURSE / REPENT SANCTUARY {xcommand.

By default everybody is NPK and thus cannot kill other players. 
However, you can choose to become PK (Player Killer). Read {YHELP

become PK but are new with Waterdeep it might be wise to learn
the game first tier and wait with PK until second tier.
