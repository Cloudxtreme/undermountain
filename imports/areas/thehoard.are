{8The {ml{8ege{Wn{8dar{my {8C{rh{yime{rr{8a {8paces here, a defiant monstrosity of nature.

{8An awesome sight, this mythical beast carries all the menacing
qualities of its heritage.  With the head of a {rl{yio{rn{8, it's proud stare
penetrates as it gazes upon its surroundings.  Forming beyond the
borders of it's mane, the body resembles that of a very muscular goat.
The chimera's hair slowly transitions from it's mane, to a luscious
shag and degrades to that of glimmering scales towards rear of the
creature.  Instead of a tail, a viscious {8s{ge{8r{Gp{8e{gn{8t {8protrudes from the
opposing end of the animal, gazing in all directions as it's tongue
protrudes from time to time, tasting the air for danger.  {x

Magic is, paradoxically, both simple and complex.  The complexity lies in the
difficult mental disciplines that must be mastered, and the lifetime study to
find "true," usable, knowledge.  The actual use of magic is easy, once one has
learned how.  To utilize magic, the adept must learn mental disciplines and be
able to rid oneself of distracting thoughts and emotions, to concentrate upon
one thought, one sharp focus, in order to direct the Weave.  To be effective,
an adept must be able to take this art of concentration one step further and
be able to relax, clear his mind, and focus under the most distracting of
conditions.  It is a meditative art that must be learned to perfection before
an approach to the magical processes can be attempted.

He awoke to a strange sound, not coming from the forest around
them.  The fire had long since died out, and Caerin was still
fast asleep amidst her makeshift bed of leaves. "Was it a dream"
he thought as he tried to perceive the sound he heard. Nothing.
{x
The wind rustled some trees, but was silent once more. As Levasi
rested his head once again upon the log, he heard the sound again,
this time recognizing it's origin.  Quickly, he stood to his feet
and strapped his swordbelt around his waist. Unsheathing it with
care, he ducked behind a large tree and waited. As Caerin slept,
he watched as they flew around slowly to her left, then to her
right, treading with care so as not to awake her.  Levasi smiled
and watched as the group of faeries prodded her gently with a
stick, and then proceeded to circle the campsite for signs of
others. 
{x
After several minutes of this, they began to gather up all they
could carry of the few trinkets which caught their eye.  They
took everything that wasn't fastened down, and then some that
were, including the buttons from the garments Caerin left 
hanging near the fire. They were so busy in their work, that
none of the four realized that Levasi stood in the shadows
holding his jacket slightly open. As they worked at the threads
on the garments, Levasi quickly rushed in to capture them.  Two
were quick enough to escape, but two struggled beneath the thick
leather of the jacket, yelling for their freedom. Caerin awoke 
to their pleas, and could do nothing but laugh, for it looked
as if she may still get back her pendant.

It is the opinion of modern physitians that this way of making up Medicines
was invented only to deceive the pallat, that so by swallowing them down whole,
the bitterness of the medicine might not be perceived or at least it might not
be unsufferable, and indeed most of their pills though not all are very bitter. 
{x
I am of a clean contrary Opinion to this, I rather think they were done up in
this hard form that so they might be the longer in digesting, and my opinion
is grounded upon reason too, not upon fancy nor hear-say. The first invention
of pills was to purge the Head, now as I told you before, such Infirmities as
lay neer the passages, were best removed by logiston, because they pass to the
grieved part soonest, so here, if the infirmity lie in the head or any other
remote part, the best way is to use pills, because they are longer in digestion,
and therefore the better able to call the offending Humor to them. 
{x
If I should tell you here a long tale of medicines working by sympathy and
antipathy, you would not understand a word of it, they that are fit to make
physitians may find it in the treatise: all modern physitians know not what
belonged to a sympathetical cure, no more than a chocobo knows what belongs to
flats and Sharps in music, but follow the vulgar road, and call it a hidden
quality and indeed none but astrologers can give a reason of it, and science

The modern traveler can now take advantage of the progress of our
technology to sail away beyond far horizons in lands not yet known
to the current world.  Indeed, it is made possible by the wonderful
contraption known as the Airship. Like a sailing vessel, these
mammoths tread the clouds and range from relatively small, single
seater models, to large cruisers that are used for high cargo
capacity and for protecting one's own interests.
{X
To the distant Ishtar Sea, one can still find the fortress island
of Accomaxx, which is inhospitable for landing a sailing vessel.
However, the airship enthusiast can afford another option to land
directly upon the island.  It is not unlike any fortress known,
highly advanced in armament and in modern luxury, and can be an
interesting place for all interests.
{x
Turning further southeast, one can find Paradise Island precariously
set among the Sea of Swords.  This island truly is paradise, with
beautiful sandy beaches, vegetation, and a tropical climate not like
any known throughout the realms. Accomidations are also luxurious, 
for a price of course, but today's traveler can easy afford the
modest price for anything but modest arrangements.  As all part of
the island are a marvel to behold, one does not have to bother with
asking for a room with a view.
{X
If adventure, excitement, and danger fit one's agenda, turn your
compass towards the likes of Heifong III, a pirate capital that is
only accessible by means of airship. I warn you in advance: the
city is not for the faint of heart, for danger lies around every

strange railway of the undead, which resides to the east. Once
one steps foot upon the train, they cannot leave, and many have

These accounts herein are of those of mine own eyes or spoken
by those who witnessed the climax and aftermath of a war waged
by the dark race known as the orcs against the City of Splendors
in the Year of the Black Horde. Not even by the hand of Beshaba
would I have believed such sights I beheld with mine own eyes.
To the north they came down upon the city, first in small groups
which were easily held back by our fortifications, but with
increasing days, they grew in numbers. Two weeks we fought back
those few who scaled its heights as crudely crafted rams worked
at the gates and sides day and night. Then they came in force
out of the mountains and hills like a black deluge of ungodly
mass. It came upon us so fast that we were hardly at means to
recover against it, but we did.  My friend and companion,
Ehtaine, was with me upon one of the northeastern towers as we
worked at the masses first with our arrows, then with anything
we could find to hurl upon them. This went on for many weeks,
then weeks became months.  During the night, it was like
warring the shadows, for one could only hear the infernal yells
of their infantry and the crushing of bone and flesh from the
bricks we hurled upon them. Ehtaine and myself sacrificed our
hearths for the good of our city, as many others did for their
salvation. There were spans of several days when the hoards
would back down, but they always came back in force, and we
dreaded every moment up to the point when their war cries 
carried over the hills once again. I cannot describe to you the
horror of the townspeople and of the many who died by their own
hands. The orcs would defile all they kill, including those of
their own, for nothing escaped their treachery. Approaching the
third month, supplies and water ran short. We could not drink
from our freshwater sources, as the orcs had defiled them with
excrement the first week of the seige. We prayed to all gods we
held dear for rain, especially to Istishia, Lanthandar,
Sylvanus, and even Umberlee for shifting rain clouds. The rain
came, but it did not last long, and we found ourselves at
constant kneeling to the powers that be to grant us asylum from
this place. Who knew that of all that would bid an answer to
our call, Akadi heard our plea, and brought us the winged
griffons which would send us over the hordes to safety.

titan lore~
[Excerpt from the first chapter] {x

The titan exodous from the higher plains came about in a relatively short
amount of time. The event is recorded in titan legend as a shooting star
from celestial beginnings and portrays six elder titans descending from
their planescape to a lush valley surrounded by forest and mountains. 
It was in that valley that the first titans came to settle here in the
Great Realms. Centuries of peace saw two key changes to titan culture
1) titans shed away their fierce, warlike nature and made communion with
their surrounding natural environment creating what they themselves call
the strengthening of mind 2) as sons and daughters of the greater gods,
titans were blessed with immortality and immense stature. Centuries of
peaceful existence among mortals saw their size shrink down to sizes
more indicative of the humanoids about them. Titans though long living,
are not immortal. Still they are rumored to live very long lives, some
argue for millenia. Indeed titans are a strange and wonderful race.

Makou energy can be harnessed with the use of magical rods.  These
rods, enchanted with varies spells, will attract mako energy.  These
rods are placed in the reactor core of a Class A Makou Reactor.  The
rods attract the energy, gather it and sends it to the compression
chamber, through iron rods, wrapped into each other.  Steam from the
steam engines in the reactor compress the energy in the chamber which
is thrown between two iron rods, will cause a chemical reaction and
creature diffrent forms of mako.  Diffrent pressures will give
diffrent results, but depends on the reactor type.  Class A reactors
produce Makou Gas, which after compressed in the chambers, is pumped
out to storage tanks, and into your homes.  Most reactors are started
by coal for the steam engine, but after makou gas is produced, it
creates the fire for the steam engine.

Many years passed without any problems or 
significant events. The villagers became 
richer and richer and soon a city council 
was  formed.  With  the raised  taxes and 
dues,  a temple  dedicated  to the elvish 
Goddess  Hanali was  build, not far north 
of  the village.  People from  the  whole 
region  met at  the  temple, not only  to 
worship,  but also to  catch up with each 
other. Time  passed by and  the villagers 
lived  together  in peace  and happiness.{x

All  this good fortune  suddenly ended in 
the year 1193.  In this year,  a group of 
bandits under  the leadership of Monzuka, 
attacked and looted the temple of Hanali. 
Afterwards they destroyed  it with a very 
powerful  spell.  It  is still  suspected 
that another Deity was behind this spell, 
since  it is not  likely any mortal,  not 
even  a  powerful  member  of the  Wizard 
Council, would  be   powerful  enough  to 
destroy a temple of this  dimensions. The 
village was only  lightly damaged and was 
soon  repaired,  but the  damage  to  the 
sacred temple of Hanali was  irreparable.{x

The surviving priests,  together with the 
citizens,  collected money to build a new 
temple.  They did  not have  the means to 
remove the old one and decided to keep it 
as a memorial. The second temple was even 
larger  then the first one,  but with the 
help of hired  workers,  the  temple  was 
completed  quite fast. It  was more  then 
able t o provide  enough room to the many 
faithful of  Hanali in the region of Tru.{x

Only a few  months ago, during the night, 
it  was  again  attacked,   now  by  much 
powerful forces. The bandits, descendants 
of Monzuka,  suddenly  came  out  of  the 
forest,  riding on  large  war  dogs  and 
accompanied  by even  larger beasts of an 
unknown kind.  The huge  beasts  trampled 
the  priests who  tried to flee or fight. 
The bandits  soon conquered  the  temple, 
there  was not much  of a fight,  for the 
temple was  only guarded by a few priests 
during this night.

The bandits stayed and  hid themselves in 
the temple.  Vectorian troops  arrived in 
the town and started to  guard the access 
roads. Any  attempts to regain the temple 
were unsuccessful. The  citizens lived in 
fear, hidden in their houses. Some people 
left. 
{*
It became  even worse when the  merchants 
started to use  other routes, because the 
trade  route near Tru was too  dangerous. 
In the next  months the  Vectorian guards 
were  slowly withdrawn  from  the  region 
near Tru.  The village was  no longer  an 
important trade  post, so not interesting 
anymore.

A few brave  heroes and  Vectorian guards 
tried to investigate  the second  temple. 
Only  a few returned, describing horrible 
scenes. They  told the villagers that the 
heroes, the  priests and the  bandits, or 
at  least what was  left of them,  looked 
like  they  were  torn  to  pieces by  an 
extremely  powerful  and  immoral  force.

The  situation has not  changed much yet, 
people are still scared of  both temples. 
The spirits of  the fallen roam about the 
path towards the first temple, not a very 
cheering  sight.  Until the  whole temple 
has been searched, none  of the villagers 
will  come  one step closer to  the ruins 
than absolutely necessary for him or her.{x

"So it was all a trick!  We were taken in by a millennia old
trick!" {wBosch remarked, half laughing, half in awe. {M "Yes, I can
still hear them laughing" {wI replied, gesturing toward my head. {M"I
upset some delicate balance, and the avalanche came down upon me!"
{w
For a moment, we sat in the bakery and mused about this, not quite
sure what to say, and then I laughed.  Then he laughed, and we had
a good time out of it in the end. I finally intervened for our
sanity:  {M"So back to you again. How the hell did you manage this
faction?"   
{C
"When you did not return, I set the plan in motion, mustering up
the supporters of our faction and petitioning the Tripower for our
cause. And then we waited and hoped you would come back, but set
about the plan as usual.  Interest died down, but it was not
forgotten. This week we have won two great victories:  our faction
and your return.  We have the official word:  Myth Drannor is in
our protection."
{w
I nodded, and found the words to reply, "There are a lot of things
to do now." I remarked.  {M"We have to round up our support and
organize our cause. We cannot do this alone-."
{C
"In due time, Clausius." {whe said, smiling.  {C"Answers will present
themselves, for now we have much catching up to do.  Come, lets
have a drink.  I brought some homebrew that'll make slap your mama!"
{w
I nodded at the truth he spoke. There was much that I had to catch
up with, and for several hours we did, and others joined us,
friends and acquaintances from long ago...you know who you are for
you were there.
{w
Just before returning to my home, Bosch stopped me outside in
Market Square, {C"One thing bothers me about your side of the story.
If you upset some delicate balance set up within the scroll, and
only bad things manifested, then where is the good of it all?  Did
you ever attain the knowledge that was promised?"

tapped my brow with my finger, {M"In due time, old friend, for

{c
In the wake of our experiments with the scroll, the Tripower Empire,
under the instrumentality of the organization known as Nytek, was
busy with experiments of their own, many involving the meld of magic
and technology. I had a side interest in their progress, namely in
the field of airship mechanics. On one of my "information gathering"
trips to Torregiano, I met someone who I could only describe as odd.
{w
A tall man, with copper hair and green eyes and a little pet ferret
walked into the bar where I sat that evening. He wore a strange shield
and belt, and carried an even stranger staff. His markings were
familiar, but at the same time, very different for this part of the
world.  I could tell that he wasnt from these parts.  
{w
I remember getting a bit inebriated and having a conversation with
him, namely about airships and travels to the west.  That was where
the conversation seemed to steer itself.  He was very much fascinated
with airship travel, and we talked and drank the night away. He was
one hell of a drinker to keep up with, which is another reason I knew
him to not be from these parts.  Gaolong was with me, drunk as ever,
and kept himself busy with chasing the ferret around trying to eat it.
Ramus was also there, though he didnt care much for conversation.  He
just sat in the corner with his bottle.  
{w
I recall fixing my eyes upon the orb at the end of his staff, which
seemed to beckon me. When I drew near, it glowed with an intense green,
and I amused myself with this for several minutes. The glow made me
giggle.  
{w
I thought nothing of it, and staggered home to bed. Turning out the
lights, I remember an intense green haze had filled my bedchambers
and made it very difficult to get some shuteye. {m"Damn magical lights
messing with me at night!" {wI cursed, only later having the sense to
see that it was that scroll glowing in my half-open bag. 
{c
Somehow, that stranger enchanted the scroll to the point that when I
opened it, it was like opening a familiar book. I saw clearly the
spindles of a spell which could reach into the recesses of the mind,
endowing powerful knowledge to any source the caster chose to direct
it. Needless to say, I didn't sleep the rest of the night.
{w
Instead I sat up thinking about this strange man in Torregiano. Was
he of some higher power, perhaps blessed by the gods, or an immortal
himself? Or was he just a man from a place far more developed than
ours? I sketched the markings from his armor and dug in my archive
for answers. It took perhaps an hour to find a small book with similar
markings. This particular book was given to me by Grandal. He found it
in the High Tower of Sorcery along with an amulet, which I now recall
as bearing that same design. All signs pointed to his lineage as
coming from the Great Wizard's Council.  It was plausible that he
could have unlocked such an ancient spell with ease (enough that he
didn't even realize it). 
{M
"And that is where I left off shortly before returning to my
bedchambers with the scroll" {wI remarked to Bosch, who passively
turned his head from side to side, which meant he was listening
intently. {M"I mustered up some courage, shrugged off the voice of
reason and read from the scroll. It caught afire in my hands, a
bright green one, and sent me reeling across the room with the
force of a hundred ton sledge. I gathered enough strength to crawl
upon my bed, and then there was darkness..."

"Well Bosch, you are apparently the dwarf of the hour, so you tell me
what the hell is going on."  {wI replied, as I tossed the front page in
front of him.  {C"The scroll, you used it I assume," {whe said.  {C"I knew
you couldn't resist forever!" 
{w
Silence. Lots of sparks but no light bulb.
{w
I shook my head.  He laughed.  {C"Ok, ok, I understand you are confused.
Let me explain over dinner.  I am craving some fried chicken if you
will do the honors.  Oh right, another thing to cover..."
{w
And so he filled me in on everything leading up to my sleep. It all
came back to me at once, though I allowed him the pleasure of seeing
the story to its end.  In the interest of time, let me paraphrase his
tale:
{g
Our meeting was through the wizard's guild.  He was a new student
of the arts, with a lore for relics, both past and present.  His
knowledge of ancient facts was only paralleled by his ability to learn
new ones, and so I took him in as a student and gave him access to my
library and archives. It was also then that I told him of my plans to
construct a great archive, a place where all could come to find
information. He was immediately sold on the notion, and the Keepers of
Antiquity was mainly his brainchild. I should clarify and give credit
where it's due, for without Bosch, my idea remained only a scribble on
parchment.  
{g
He learned quickly and efficiently, though he was impulsive and
sometimes impatient.  Within half a year, he had exhausted all of the
resources from my archives and private library, and so it was decided
that an expedition into the Ruined City was in order. Under the veil
of invisibility, we slipped by the demons within and found our way
into an old shop; the original intent seemed to be a shop of magic,
judging from the arcane symbols which adorned the walls.  While
picking fragments of paper from the cracks of the stone floor, Bosch
stumbled upon a loose one, and beneath it was a crumpled scroll, tied
together with strands of leather.  
{g
We took it back with us, along with a few small items, and opened it
up.  Across the top, it bared the name: {8"Scroll of the Waking Mind"{g,
and the rest were bits of sentences and nonsensical phrases, most of
which were really funny when said aloud. In the interest of our
safety and well-being, I will not. 
{g
For weeks it sat upon my mantle, and in that time we probed it for
all of the secrets it contained.  Through stacks and stacks of books
we searched for a translation.  Nothing came from our efforts. 
{C
"And that is where I last left you.  We came looking for weeks
afterwards, but there must have been a spell ward active on you,
for all our efforts at contact failed"{w, Bosch concluded with a
sigh.  {C"We were thinking perhaps you grew tired of us and left for
your old solitude."
{w
That last statement actually sounded appealing to me, though I
refrained from mentioning it.  I continued the story where he
left off.  {M"It stayed with me for quite a long time afterwards,
going where I did in hopes I would find the right person to help me
decipher it." {wI continued.  {M"The right person can come at the
strangest of times."

{M
"Why that rat bastard did it!" {wI muttered to myself as glared at the
paper.  
{c
Here is a good time to explain that the Keepers of Antiquity was an
idea never realized in my prior state. It was an idea I held onto for
perhaps most of my life, with two attempts made at building a great
archive set to preserve the legacy of our world. Both of those attempts,
I would say, have failed, but the latter made for one hell of a
summer home.  
{c
The premise behind the Keepers was a group of good-natured individuals,
who would take up the ambiguous task of cataloging and preserving the
world as we know it and once knew it. The need for preservation came to
me when I was very young, after my exile from the Valley of Titans
while in the company of elves (I shall save this story for later, if
time and the audience permits). It was the stories of the loss of one
of their greatest cities that drew me into my current occupation. It
was much later on that the Ruined City was found, and treasures poured
from its shattered gates into art galleries and private collections
across the realms, with little or no regard for what it once
represented.  It was a place shrouded in intrigue, and the shattered
remains of that great city are forever haunted by the demons who will
not let her spirit rest.  It was a place dear to my heart, which echoed
of the races who lived in harmony within.  It was my obsession.
{w
This takes my story up to that afternoon.  After a few strolls around
the city, I made my way back to the bakery for an early dinner. This
time I opted for the local ale, which was a little better. {cFor really
good ale, I suggest Jack's Bar in Torregiano. Damn good stuff, and you
meet interesting people there, too, which Ill get to in a moment. For
now, the interesting person of the day walked into the bakery at about
the time I sat down with my food.
{w
Barely making eye contact, he approached my table, boosted himself up
onto the chair, and smiled, his beard curling up on the marred tabletop
like a coiled snake.  With a rather raspy voice, he said, {C"Didn't take
long for you to crack it.  I knew if anyone could, it would have been
you."

{w
So for perhaps the next three hours we caught up on things. As you
could imagine, the conversation was a bit one-sided. A few highlights
involved people that I never was fond of leaving the world, presumed
dead, and there were some newcomers who had been coming around that
from the sound of it weren't half bad. The sight of airships was
apparently no big thing now, and it seemed that everyone who's anyone
carried with them relics that had appeared out of the west. When Gao
told this part, he stressed the details, not doubt appealing to my
blatant curiosity. {M"I should have to build a new wing in my archives
for these things" {wI said to him.  Of course he countered with a snide
remark that I have censored here, mainly because I can.
{w
But of all the new things he filled me in on, perhaps the most
intriguing was this business of a new order of government. I vaguely
remember the declaration some time before my unfortunate accident.
Speculations made rounds that internal corruption had weakened the
Tripower Empire, and that factions were a last ditch effort to keep
order.  Another popular one was that these so called 'factions' were
only puppets to a dictator who would take the stage in the next scene.
I had to discount the latter, for reasons that will become evident
shortly.  As long as there will be glory hounds, there will be
speculation.
{w
We wound up our conversation with a few lighthearted remarks and the
Gao stood up and said {G"I have a match to prepare for, so I must get
going.  I am going to try out some new equipment, so wish me luck!"
{wAs he walked out the door, he stabbed a piece of paper with his sword
and lifted it towards me.  {G"Page 3 has something interesting that I
didnt get around to mentioning.  Have a look!"
{w
Pulling the page from his sword, he bid me good day and I resumed my
seat in the corner.  The front page was plastered with the following
headline: {W"The People Have Spoken:  Pax Faerunis to Rule Westbridge
Territory." {wFrom there was dwarfed the actual article which read from
an account of the polls.  There was a boxed list of members to the
left, and I could recall many of the names, despite my disjointed
memory.  They were a nice bunch really, and I would have time later
on to congratulate them once this business of getting settled back
into my life was over.  On the next page was a smaller heading that
read, {W"Other Factions To Rule Various Parts of the Realms" {wand second
from the top of a short list was a name which struck me like a brick:
{w
The Keepers of Antiquity...

{c
I was Clausius Sagacus, son of Valine, born in the Valley of Titans,
raised by elves, and admitted into the guild of sorcery the 17th year
of my worldfall. This resulted in the solitary life that I knew well,
and ultimately to my odd infatuation with the past. 
{c
Yes, yes, facts about myself, but I wouldn't be throwing them out
there if they did not bear some relevance to my tale.  My father
actually had a different name in mind for me, but my mother wouldn't
have it.  As if I actually knew either of them very well.  A story
for another time...
{c
Anyway, where was I?  Oh yes, sitting in the bakery drinking my
pisswater. I had to order a third pot pie to soak it up.  {wAs I
choked down the brew, I dove into the black soup that is my mind
for some more answers. There was a faint presence, almost alien,
in there. {m"Hello, there intruder. What are you doing inside there?"
{wNo answer.  I could hear it vaguely, laughing. It was gone again.
I sought it for answers, but nothing.  
{w
Then came a sound I could not mistake for my life...
{w
I was across the table in the time it took for the blade to be drawn.
It was Sunderfury.  Looking behind me, I soon saw the familiar face
of Gaolong laughing at me as he pointed his sword toward my food.
Before I could blink, he lifted it up in the air and caught it as it
slid down the length of his blade.  Gaolongs infernal laughing
drowned out the delicate ring of the blade.
{M
"You bastard" {wI protested, but I could not expect anything less from
him.  If ever you have a chance to meet him, you will find him to be
a rather showy character.  Just watch your dinner.
{G
Where you been?" {wGao asked between bites, {G"We thought you were dead.
{M
"I was a bit detained in my dreams," {wI said, not knowing what else to
say. {M"I just woke up from one hell of a sleep and found my way here.
What day is it anyway?"
{w
Gaolong thought a moment, tapping his sword against the ground as he
sat.  {G"13th of Uktar, if Im not mistaken.  Yah, thats the day!  I
got my match coming up."  {wHe pointed to the flyer with the words {W"Gao
Schlong" {wwritten beneath his name. A once crude depiction of him was
now adorned with a moustache and a pair of rose-tinted shades.  I
cracked an uncontrollable smile.
{w
Uktar...Crunching the numbers in my head, I came up with approximately
9 months of slumber, and only if it was still the same year.  It was
a miracle that I was still alive, but the whole situation had the
hints of powerful magics at play.  Though I was curious about how
long it really had been, I decided it was best that I didnt know
just yet.  When you get my age, a couple of years of sleep could do
you good. Hell, waking up every morning is a blessing, so why push it.
{w
I looked over Gaolong with admiration.  He had acquired a few more
interesting pieces of equipment that glimmered with his own personal
touches.  Most were mangled so badly with his own personal touches,
that no one else would want to touch it.  A few more scars, but other
than that, he hadnt changed a bit.  I forwarded the question {M"So
whats new in the realms?" {wto which I received a long reply...
{w

{W
"Clank" {wcame the sound of the door behind me. Out of reflex, I raised
my hands with some jarbled jargon at the tip of my tongue. Though I
felt foolish when I realized my haste, my actions sparked one of those
rare moments of serendipity.  I was, of course, a wizard, who found
little more use out of his sword than the Dragon Queen would find out
of a wedding dress.
{w
I commanded a vocabulary of arcane knowledge, and to this point had
been very modest in employing it.
{w
First off was this little business about starving to death. I called
upon some food, and to my dismay, a colorful fungus sprung up at my
feet. It looked more like a drug-induced piece of artwork than edible,
nothing like the rations I used to know.  I kicked it slightly with my
boot and it went flying off into the darkness, undoubtedly safe from
anyone else who might stumble upon it.  
{M
"This will not do," {wI thought.  Something began to well up inside me.
Perhaps it was a powerful spell that would bring an end to space and
time.   Nope, it was my damned stomach, who would have been very
happy eating things that appear at one's feet, but I was more of the
finicky kind. My mind mulled over the notion of hungry and out came
a name.  I found the right words and hand gestures, and in an instant,
I was there.  I could get used to this...
{M
"Westbridge" {wI said to myself.  Now this was a familiar memory. 
{c
I always thought the name was deceiving for new adventurers, for when
they set out on a quest, they always headed east, since Westbridge was,
of course, west. If you really want to pull a sneaky on them, say that
you'll meet them in Thalos.
{w
I made my way from Temple Square to Market Square, then Festival
Square, which seemed to have been claimed by the mafia in a recent
event.  I must have slept through that one. I passed a pub on the way,
and found my way back to it. I ordered a bottle of 'local specialty'
but let's just say specialty is an over fancied word for piss. Across
the way was a cafe that looked inviting, but that was neither here nor
elsewhere in my desires.
{w
Making my way back toward the fountain, I veered left into a rundown
pit of a joint, better known to most as Tom's Bakery. There, I
purchased two massive pot pies and found my favorite table at the far
corner. It was marred with the carving of people's names I did not
recognize. Only faintly did I see my own, and that of a friend, which
remained freshly cut into the soft oak.  Tacked along the walls were
flyers advertising the arena, as well as several obscene comments hand
written below the contestants names.   A few made me laugh.
{w
And so I sat and ate my pies and nursed my ale and pondered things.
Memories trickled in like late runners in a marathon. Some were good,
many were bad, a few were just plain strange. I dwelled on each memory
just as I savored each bite of my breakfast. Of the last recollection
to jog in was my name...

Let me see, I suppose I should start with three days ago, since my
story began then.  Well it actually began about 170 years ago, but
never mind the details...
{w
I remember the colors drifting in and out of my field of view.  The
loud rush of silence rang in my ears. Patterns of darkness swirled
and gathered into focus. My head swam with confusion.  It was the
ceiling of my bedchambers, set in what would one day become my grand
archive. {c(For those who don't know, I sleep there also).
{M
"How, where?" {wI whispered, startled by the strangeness of my own
voice.{M "It is real?!"
{w
But I cannot deny my own senses. It was if I had awakened, or been
pulled, from some other reality into a world that remained until this
day an afterthought. My mind grasped for the retreating fibers of a
dream set in the depths of reality, but came up empty handed.
{w
I rose to my feet as beads of chilling sweat ran down my face. A pile
of ashes lay scattered across my bed. They disintegrated to the touch.
I looked over to the perpetus counter on the bed stand.  It had
stopped quarter phase mid-month. My muscles ached immensely, almost to
the point of atrophy.  As I started to move, I became aware that my
equipment had become tangled in the bed sheets.  Why I chose to sleep
fully geared was beyond me.  I reasoned it as yet another mystery to
solve.
{w
I stumbled over to the chest of drawers, the hardware black with
tarnish, and leaned upon the timber for support. Looking into the
mirror, which hung nearby, a faint image of myself came into view
amidst the scattered moonbeams.  It was an apparition that I met eye-
to-eye--long beard, bony face, and wrinkled complexion.  Apparently, I
had overextended the benefits of beauty sleep.
{w
I rubbed the shaggy beard and backed away from the image.  Some things
were familiar, like my clothes and the furniture, but others were not, 
ike who the hell I was.
{w
I walked through the hallway, passing piles of masonry and unmixed
mortar to the foyer.  Directly ahead was the library, the door still
slightly ajar, and to the right was the doorway outside, which I
approached.  The deadbolt would not budge, and so, unsheathing my
sword, I proceeded to beat it into submission with the hilt.  It
finally gave, and the door opened with a loud creak. I stepped outside
into the foreboding depths of Drannor Forest, but don't ask me where I
thought I was going.

Introduction:
{x
It has been a long journey that I began alone and now I take with my friends
knowns as the Keepers.  We have been through thick and thin, but we have been
through it together, and though our humble faction may not hope for immortality,
our legacy will have it.
{x
Herein is a recorded history of our beginnings, as told from my point of view.
I cannot tell it any other way, and my story serves as a guidance to those who
would take up the burden I have undertaken for these many years.  It is one of
the contingencies of life that I have learned to accept my own mortality, and
for my friends, the Keepers, I hope to leave a little of myself with them when
I part this world in peace.
{x
And without further ado, please enjoy this book, and read it a reverent heart.

Introduction:
{x
It has been a long journey that I began alone and now I take with my friends
knowns as the Keepers.  We have been through thick and thin, but we have been
through it together, and though our humble faction may not hope for immortality,
our legacy will have it.
{x
Herein is a recorded history of our beginnings, as told from my point of view.
I cannot tell it any other way, and my story serves as a guidance to those who
would take up the burden I have undertaken for these many years.  It is one of
the contingencies of life that I have learned to accept my own mortality, and
for my friends, the Keepers, I hope to leave a little of myself with them when
I part this world in peace.
{x
And without further ado, please enjoy this book, and read it a reverent heart.

It all depends on me, you see. Nothing is certain until I have behald it and set it in 
place, until I have placed myself above it or below, before or after. Let them keep 
their temples to Oghma the Unknowing, their shrines to Mystra the Whore of Magic 
and Mielikki the Barren Forest. Let them scorn me if they dare. I am the One, the All, 
the Face Behind the Mask.

The Words of {%C{5y{8r{5i{%c {8the {5A{8l{5l{x, as spoken on the Night of Despair:
 
It depends on me of course, everything does.
Who shall live. Who shall die. What is, what shall be.
Imagine I am watching from above, hovering in the sky as mortals
are wont to thinkwe gods do. The vast sea lies below, forever slapping 
at the rocky shore of the Sword Coast, where Candlekeep's towers of 
profane ignorance sit upon the pedistal of a black basalt tor. With a breath
I could blast that bastion of falsity down, powder the mortar between its
stones and send its high walls crashing into the sea, scatter its twisted
tomes to the bubbling mires and the deep stinking oceans int he far corners
of the world...

A prayer for the {%F{5ai{8th{5fu{%l{x:
Praise be to Cyric the All, Most Mighty, Highest of the High,
the Dark Sun, the Black Sun, the Lord of Three Crowns,

All blessings and strength upon his Church and his Servants, who alone shall rule over 
the Kingdom of mortals and dwell forever in the Palace of Eternity in the time
beyond the Year of Carnage.

{*   ===={W( {cII. {WHistory of Flight {x
{x
{*     The first attempt at an airship was made by the Vectorians {x
{*     during the 8th century. Utilizing steam technology, of {x
{*     which they were the creators, the Vectorians attempted to{x
{*     convert a normal ship by attaching a helium filled blimp. {x
{*     This attempt was a failure because the weight of the steam {x
{*     system was too heavy for helium to support. Considering the {x
{*     rarity of helium, and the quantity needed to lift the {x
{*     system, this attempt was written off.{x
 
{*     With the invention of makou gas, a new wave of creations {x
{*     flourished. The most important would have to be the makou {x
{*     combustion engine. Lighter and more powerful than steam {x
{*     engines, it is better suited for the airship environment. {x
{*     Additionally, makou gas forms #2 and #3 made the technology {x
{*     practical. Gas #3 provides sludge like fuel for the engine, {x
{*     while the non-combustible gas #2 provided a cheap, {x
{*     non-volatile substitute for helium.{x
{x
{*     The first generation of successful airships, such as Battle {x
{*     Cruisers and War Cruisers, still utilize makou gas #2 and {x
{*     armored blimps for floatation. However, second generation {x
{*     airships have replaced the blimp with internal ballasts, {x
{*     allowing for smaller, faster airships that only require a {x
{*     single person to operate.{x

{x
{*     For sheer size and fire power, the larger ships are ideal. {x
{*     Though slower, they can hold an army for deployment and can {x
{*     lay down some serious damage.{x
{x
{*     However, for cargo runs, piracy, and quick combat, there is {x
{*     nothing better than a single seater. Fast, small, and {x
{*     controlled by a single person, they can move in, hit, and {x
{*     leave before larger ships can react.{x
{x
{*     When building an airship, there are three things to consider: {x
{*     engines, hulls, and weaponry. Here are some tips when trying {x
{*     to decide:{x
{x
{c       - {*Do not purchase a better hull until you can afford the {x
{*         best hull. It is a waste of money to go anywhere but {x
{*         the top.{x
{c       - {*The same rule for hulls applies to cannons. Smaller {x
{*         guns do not sell back for much and enemies will escape{x
{*         before these weak cannons can disable them.{x
{c       - {*Always get the Munchausen engine. The sheer power of {x
{*         teleportation is vital for an airship.{x
{c       - {*Max out the engines. Vertical motion is controlled by {x
{*         lift engines, and horizontal motion is controlled by {x
{*         drive engines. Get as many as possible, as powerful {x
{*         as needed to push the airship to its max speed.{x

{x
{*     Tactics vary slightly depending on what is happening. There {x
{*     are two basic battle scenarios. {x
{x
{*     First of all, there is piracy. This is when the victim is {x
{*     running cargo. Generally they are not willing or capable of {x
{*     defending themselves. Most people utilize autopilot and {x
{*     follow major trade routes.{x
{x
{*     The other scenario would be basic combat. This is when the {x
{*     other airship is actively firing and hunting. This is a {x
{*     complete different situation which requires unique tactics.{x
{x
{W      Piracy{x
{*     --------{x
{c       - {*Waiting at Torregiano cargo office allows recon of {x
{*         potential targets.{x
{c       - {*When a target is picked, wait along the known path.{x
{c       - {*Always pick a spot with a long straight path. More shots {x
{*         will be able to be fired before the target passes.{x
{c       - {*Use directional ping. It gives a longer view than {x
{*         traditional ping.{x
{c       - {*Do not wait for the target to enter range. Fire as soon {x
{*         as the target is detected  cannonballs are slow.{x
{c       - {*When a target is disabled, quickly board and remove the {x
{*         keys from the ignition.{x
{c       - {*Always take pirated cargo to Heifong or Makou.{x
{x
{W      Combat{x
{*     --------{x
{c       - {*Hit and run! Never sit still.{x
{c       - {*Always use active ping.{x
{c       - {*Never fly in straight lines  this makes for an easy {x
{*         target.{x
{c       - {*Always keep track of hull damage. Get out when it {x
{*         reaches around 4000.{x
{c       - {*Use teleport if retreat is required.{x
{c       - {*Hiding at a beacon masks the airship from active pings. {x
{*         Note that it does NOT mask against directed pings.{x

{*  |{w  The Order of the Radiant Heart utilizes an encryption   {*|{x
{*  |{w  scheme which, at first glance, appears near to          {*|{x
{*  |{w  impossible to break. However, with just a little bit    {*|{x
{*  |{w  of time to study the system, our scholars broke it      {*|{x

{*  |{w  The complexity comes from the massive table of          {*|{x
{*  |{w  alphabets. Each row of the table contains the entire    {*|{x
{*  |{w  alphabet, with the next row shifted one character to    {*|{x
{*  |{w  the left.                                               {*|{x

{*  |{w  A set key is used, in this case the Order uses the name {*|{x
{*  |{w  of their patron, Torm. For this system to work, the key {*|{x
{*  |{w  is repeated over and over till it is the same length as {*|{x
{*  |{w  the message that they are trying to encrypt.            {*|{x
{*  |{w                                                          {*|{x

{*  |{w  Then, starting in the first row of the table, find the  {*|{x
{*  |{w  first letter of the plaintext. Maintaining that column, {*|{x
{*  |{w  travel down the rows until the first letter of the row  {*|{x
{*  |{w  matches the first letter of the key. Whatever letter is {*|{x
{*  |{w  in this location is what is used to replace the         {*|{x

{*  |{w  Our scholars have developed a quicker way to use this   {*|{x

{*  |{w  letter with its numerical position in the alphabet,     {*|{x
{*  |{w  starting at zero, a simple set of equations can be      {*|{x
{*  |{w  used.                                                   {*|{x

{*  |{w  In this case, "i" stands for the Ith letter of the      {*|{x
{*  |{w  message.                                                {*|{x

{*  |{w  So for i=8, P(i) = T and K(i) = M. T is the 19th        {*|{x
{*  |{w  character in the alphabet, and M is the 12th            {*|{x
{*  |{w  character. Thus, the equation would be:                 {*|{x
{*  |{w                                                          {*|{x

{*  |{w  Knowing that they use the key TORM, these two           {*|{x
{*  |{w  equations can be used to quickly encrypt and decrypt    {*|{x

{8 Here can be found the many implements and tools neccesary to those
with an obligation to extirpate a target.  Steam jets from corners of
the forge as the process begins to create new implements of
eradication.  Metals of the highest quality hiss and scream as they
are heated and broken down into a form more valuable to their fate, to
teach men of their own.  Clashing against these sounds is the
thunderous and rhythmic tone of the blacksmith's hammer, tempering the
metals into the forms they will assume for their aid to members of the
Hoard.  {x

figure standing at the entrance.  On one of the lanterns, a perched
raven caws softly to the sky.  {x
