wide-eyed as he wanders the city.  His well groomed hair is dusty
brown, his features indescript, and he is slightly underweight. 
Dotted with scars, his complexion is ruddy, pot-marked from
adolescence.  Looking slightly out of place, in a crowd he would be
simply another face, pleasant but unmemorable.

out of place on her head as it cascades down around her face.  Her
dress is long, lace-trimming burgundy, and she wears high heels that
make her look taller than she is.  Somewhat overweight, her arms are
thick but her waist oddly slender, and she looks as though she is
having difficult breathing.

Begging for money, a man crouches in the shadows pitifully.

Wrapped in a dirty cloak, he crouches in the alley and stares
bleakly at any who pass with glazed eyes.  His face is drawn, covered
in unkempt stubble, and his black hair has grown shaggy and hangs in
grime.  Strong features and a thin build would have made him handsome,
if the circumstances were different.  There is a shake to his hand and
an uncertainty to how he crouches, and the stench of beer lingers
around him.

his lips as he passes strangers with a friendly nod.  A long dagger
with an ornate handle hangs at his side.

the Iron Throne's seat in Baldur's Gate.  His hair is midnight black,
cut short and trimmed neatly around his ears.  Slate blue, his eyes
are calculating and guarded, and a scar cuts below his right eye. 
Though he is a merchant, he is strongly built, a rugged look to him in
the scruff bear he wears and the strength in his coiled muscles.

beside the door inviting passers-by.

The coastline curves here, the street following it in a gentle arc.
As it turns, the road becomes wider, opening to accomodate the traffic
from the nearby dockyards to the harbour and the market.  Stretching
out to the horizon, the oceans laps against the shore and breaks into
a low wall that follows the street.

Starting to narrow to the south, the street is wide and well used. 
A small path breaks off to the east toward the dockyards, which are
surrounded by a tall, weathered fence.  A large opening in the fence
allows crates and cargo to be taken to the harbour.  Breaking against
the short wall, the tide rolls in and out, and the calls of the
dockyard workers drift over the fence.

Not very wide, the South Path is hardly a grand street but it is
clean and scenic.  Nearby, the sound of the sea floats in the air, and
the smell of salt lingers in the air.  To the north, a small building
sits with a model standing in the window wearing a sundress and a
large hat.  A small alley cuts away to the east.

A scenic side street, the path is made of decorative cobblestone,
making its ways south toward the sea.  The calls of seagulls echo
through the air as the surf can be heard in the distance.  Down the
road the Temple of Umberlee can be seen standing its vigil by the
water, and a small, boarded up house is just off the path.

narrow road follows the wall of the temple along the shore.  Though

against the far side of the temple.  The air is thick with the scent
of salt water and the cries of seagulls, and the sounds from the docks

Meeting up with the South Path, the street moves away from the
Temple of Umberlee and meanders along the shore.  A scenic route by
the sea and so near the temple, it is kept clean and often frequented
by sightseers and visitors to the city.  The temple is to the east,
standing on tall poles that extend down into the water; the surf
crashes against them, the spray leaping upward toward the street.

Trailing beside the coast, separated from the water by a low wall,
South Street is a popular tourist spot.  The view of the sea to the
south seems to extend forever, the water disappearing over the horizon
and shimmering with reflected light.  Softly, the sound of the waves
breaking on the shore echoes, complemented by the occaisional call of
seagulls.  There is the rich scent of the sea lingering in the air.

engraved woodwork in an intricate pattern.  The windows are opened

street is frequented by visitors to Baldur's Gate.  Decorative
cobblestone makes up the street, kept clean of most debree, and lamp

wall that prevents the surf from crashing up onto the road; their

is both scenic and useful.  Lamp posts dot both sides of the road, and
more often than not, at least one person can be found wandering this

from within echoes the sound of clashing metal and the shouts of

{wD{Dockyards~
~
A small path from Bard's Crescent leads into the dockyards of
Baldur's Gate.  Here, many dock workers work to keep the shipping
system in the harbour working efficiently.  Crates are processed,
goods are prepared for loading onto the ships and many dock workers
busily move about the road.

{wD{Dockyards~
~
The dockyards come to a fairly abrupt ending here.  The only path
is the path back west to Bard's Crescent.  Many crates are piled high
here, storing many supplies, foods, gems, trinkets, clothing and
possibly even weapons or armour.  Sounds come from all around; the
constant cries of seagulls, the noise of crates being loaded and
unloaded, and the dock workers occasionally shouting or yelling
something to eachother.

All around you energy swirls and crackles.  This place has an aura
of power in it.  You are floating in a powerful mantic current that
makes it hard to move properly, as though you are floating inside some
kind of underwater lava, cold to the touch.  Sparks of energy arc
towards you and towards you and all around.  Floating near you is the
ancient elven mage, ready to train you.

Made entirely out of logs, the room is close.  A large fireplace
sits against one wall, remnants of a burned down fire in the hearth,
and a large painting is on the wall above it.  In the painting is a
vast forest, lush and green with a path leading off into the distance.
On either side of the room is a closed door, and a pair of comfortable
looking chairs sit in front of the fireplace.

A second, smaller fireplace is central to this room.  Tables and
chairs sit everywhere, covered in scrolls and books and bottles of
ink.  Bookshelves line the walls, tomes of assorted sizes and ages
gracing them; there are obvious spots where books are missing.  Piled
in the corner is a small collection of matts used for meditation, the
pile untidy and much used.

The scent of a forest is strong here, the wooden logs of the walls
giving off a distinct aroma.  Narrow but long, the room has a good
deal of open floor space, and a training dummy sits off to one side. 
Furniture fashioned of wood sits around the room, chairs, benches, and
tables scattered near the walls.  A large map is framed against one
wall, detailing the Realms.

Separating the northern and south sections of the city, the Central
Gatehouse is large but simplistic.  During the day, there is little
restriction to passing between the two halves of Baldur's Gate, and
the guards treat the post as a simple assignment.

Folly's Famous Discount Dealings~
~
This small house has been converted into a shop.  The front room
has had shelves and cabinets added so that the stock can be displayed.
The stock is very varied and most of it looks like it is a pile of
junk.  However, a few nice trinkets attract the attention of most
greedy bargain hunters.

Other than a single chair in the corner, there is no furniture in
the room.  It is wide open, the floor marked and scuffed from much
use.  A row of training targets and dummies lines one wall, and the
other is covered with cabinets filled with a variety of weaponry.  On
the wall opposite the door, a mounted sword catches the light; though
polished, there are signs telling of the use the weapon has been put
to.
