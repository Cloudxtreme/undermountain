{DClothed from head to toe in the black robes of the Church, the
canton leaves nary a trace of skin visible to the eye.  Strong of form
and lithe of stature, it is evident this guard works regularly through
the katas of defense and attack taught solely within the confines of
the Church itself.  Balanced upon the balls of his feet, it is clear
that it would be difficult to pass him should he seek to bar entry.  {x

{DThe prelate is yet the next step in the defense of the Church,
guarding the inner door to the best of his abilities and to his life's
waning breath.  Dark robes cover him from head to toe, leaving not a
trace of skin visible, making him appear not much more than a living
shadow.  Trained in the martial arts, the prelate is certain to fight
to the bitter end without giving any quarter or mercy.  Gleaming eyes
promise death.  {x

flock, the beast spouts words dedicated to the Mother, Father and Son
continuously without fail or rest.  It is a wonder, perhaps a miracle,
that the beast yet stands and hasn't fallen from exhaustion.  {x

{DYet another rung on the evolutionary ladder to perfection, the
Jenovan panther is a masterpiece of genetic manipulation.  An
amalgamation of the holy Mother's cells and a panther, this beast has
been crafted to display the best traits of both.  A single nebulous
wing grows from a massive body covered in massive serpentine scales. 
A fringe of tentacled hairs form a mane about a large head.  Three
deep-set feline eyes blink cunningly above a razor toothed maw.  Most
noticeably different about the beast is the fact that it has six legs,
rather than four, each ending in nebulous claws twice the size of a
normal panther's claw.  {x

{DDLXVII has been assigned the duty of manipulating assorted samples
with Jenova cells in order to create the perfect Church steed.  After
years of trials and failures, he was able to develop the Jenovan
panther, which has been applauded as one of the Church's greatest
successes.  A dark cowl covers much of the novitiate's face, however,
the tell-tale sign of Jenova cell exposure can be seen from the
scaling mutation upon his own talons.  A single wing protrudes from
the back of his nebulous robes, the nub of the kenku's other wing can
be seen where DLXVII amputated it in seeking communion with the One
True Son.  {x

Lending itself to things born of and growing from the earth, and

whether it is the planets wrathful reaction to the {YG{ye{Do{ys{Dt{Yi{Dg{Ym{Da{D outbreak,
impending arrival of the Father, or some unknown reason completely.

the Father, he seems to take pleasure in pain.  Scars cover his hands,
obviously retaliation from past unrepenetent visitors.  None can
defeat him, the spirit of Jenova has possessed him.  {x

dark cowl upon his head, but the part of his face that can be seen

nearby jagged trench, the {DLi{wf{Des{wt{Dre{wa{Dm rages, unstable and deadly,
killing anything within the reach of its blinding grasp.  The Church
has acquiesced to the portents of the black {DLi{wf{Des{wt{Dre{wa{Dm, considering it
the will of the Mother, Father and One True Son.  Traitors,
turn-coats, and spys are sent here to appease the spirits of the

{D  The incessant ring of metal upon metal reverberates throughout the
chamber.  Black fire flickers within the confines of the massive metal
forge.  A bellows works magically over the flames, keeping the heat
constant on the ore.  An anvil stands near a workbench, where an
assortment of files, blades, tongs, and hammers are arranged on pegs
within easy reach.  Three barrels stand near the finishing station,
one containing fresh water, the next salt water, and the last oil,
used to temper the metals being worked.  Finished pieces are arrayed
on stands and counters for review and use.   Raw ores rest in bins
near the forge.{x
