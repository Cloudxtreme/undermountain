~
{&Nan{*ea{&tha {&Sua{*ri{&l{0, the current highpriestess
of the house of the moon is deliberate, proud, and more
than a match for most of the nobles of Waterdeep. Unfortunately
she is stricken with the guilt of not recognizing her beloved
goddess during the Time of Troubles. In compensation she has
been pushing extremely hard to spread the faith of the church.
Which she has done quite succesfully.

Being the most powerful form of priest in
Selune's church, a Silverstar can cast clerical
spells so great that all of Waterdeep would
shake. But the Silverstar will never do such
a thing. For a Silverstar is hope incarnate, the
moon's light at the end of the tunnel.

As you walk down the Minstrel's Gallery you find 
yourself looking down the ledge at the beautiful
pillars containing the Halruaan urn in the Entrance
hall. Everything seems so distant up here. It's

wall hangings, and valuable pieces of the art make
most of the gallery and the rest of it is Naneatha's

throughout the hall.

by sailors and those who wish to stray away from the

Another favorite of Waterdeep's mariners is the
Hall of Ships. Lined with hundreds of meticulous
models of Waterdeep's most famous sailing ships,
these ships evoke memories of Waterdeeps famous and
infamous early maritime history. From the Pride of 
Ahgairon to the Sea of Shilarn, the most recent addition
to the hall is the Waterdhavian raker, Kiss of the Moon,

A large brick path going to a even larger building is looping
around a small park and fountain.  A beautiful statue adorns the
fountain as it gurgles silently.  As the pathway ends a grand marble
staircase leads to the church.  Amazing..

This short hallway separates the gallery
of the church from the spiritual room
located north of here.  Here on either
side of the walk north and south is lined
several panels depicting the ascension of
the Silverstars, the blessing of Selune
to mortals, the navigation of ships by
the stars, and other likenesses which 
serve to instill pride and prostrate
oneself before entering the holy church.

Another short hallway connects the back
of the church with the foyer leading off
into the main stairwell and the common
reflectory.  Aside from a wash basin
and a robe hangar, this hallway is
very plain in appearance.

This short hallway connects the hall of
learning with the chamber of the shard.
The walls are adorned with plentiful
windows that look out over the night
sky. Strangely, you seem to recall it
being daylight out, yet the stars in
the sky contrast brightly with the black
field of darkness behind.
