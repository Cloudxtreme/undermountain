{DBred for service to the Order of the Long Death, the Dire Hyena is
a beastial abomination.  Roughly five times larger than a standard
hyena, this creature is as massive as a bear with an equal appetite
for carrion and living alike.  Slavering madly as it laughs at its own
killing joke, the Dire Hyena are oft set free by the Order to ravage
at their pleasure.  Few animals appreciate and rely upon death more
than these beasts, they serve the Order well.  {x

{DGrendle is a master of the martial arts, its wirey form able to
deflect blows and intercept attacks the likes of which few members of
the Order have ever seen.  He bides his time issuing and accepting
challenges to the death.  Any battle with the beast does seem unfair,
considering the fact the troll regenerates as quickly as he is harmed.
The troll wears a black leather harnass and martial leggings.  Its
beady eyes gleam wickedly in anticipation of the fight.  {x

{DA zombie shambles forlornly within its confining cage.{x
~
{DThe undead are seen as abomination to Death itself, for nothing
that lives may escape death.  Undead found by the Order are
exterminated with extreme prejudice for any alternative to Death
cannot be tolerated.  This brainless zombie has little time of
existence left before the Order casts it to its lasting oblivion in
the Dispensation of Tusks.  Decaying flesh rots from its fetid form. 
It appears to once have been human but has long since lost much
resemblence to what it lost in life, and death.  The numerous slash
and bludgeon marks across its body speak volumes to the continuing
abuse and hatred that the members of the Order treat the undead within
their control.  {x

{DA dwarf of the Order begrudgingly prepares medical treatments.{x
~
{DGrimgnaw is a new member of the Order of the Long Death, seeking
his way in attaining oneness with the Silent Lord.  Having attained
little standing in the hierarchy of the Order, he has been assigned to
'heal' his comrades upon request.  The task is considered menial and a
lesson in futility, for no matter how many wounds one heals, Death
inevitably is certain.  Grimgnaw wears a simple adept's tunic and
little other accoutrement, as befits his lowly, contemptible position.

~
{DRap{ypsca{Dlli{yan{D is the master of the Orders' stables, in charge of the
care, feeding and comfort of the Dire Hyenas under his charge.  Were
it not for the fact that the gnoll was wearing the uniform of the
Order and walking on his rear legs, one could easily mistake him for
one of the beasts he takes care of.  A jagged scar blazes across the
blind remains of his right eye and across his snout.  Drool spills
from jagged jaws as he grips a cruel whip lovingly.  Wicked
red-blazing eyes watch the beasts about him for signs that the pack is
getting out of line, for he is the Alpha beast here.  {x

{DA sw{camp{D ha{cg{D in Order issue fiddles with a mortar and pestle.{x
~
{DGranted that the Order does not make a practice of avoiding or
attempting to cheat death, they do, from time to time, suffer an
'accident' requiring an antidote or refreshment of powers in order to
continue carrying out their grander scheme.  This hag is highly
knowledgeable in baneful and beneficial concoctions.  Though her
pleasure extends more into the realm of masterful poisons, she has
conceded to provide the Order with cures as required, for a price,
that is.  One can never be certain that what one gets from her IS
actually a cure, rather than a poison, but Death comes for all.  Her
lankey grey hair is plasered to her greenish, warty moist skin. 
Yellowed rheumy eyes peer suspictiosly under thick brows.  {x

{DA l{Gi{Dza{grd{Dma{gn{D tends to his reptilian cousins.{x
~
{DThe Order has come to rely heavily upon the practitioners of poison
and venoms in the completion of their higher calling and worship of
Death.  Were it not for members such as the stalwart Sssalisssar, the
Order would not have access to some of the more lethal venins and
toxins currently in the world.  The lizardman lovingly cares for his
reptilian charges, ensuring that their every necessity is met.  His
scaley hide appears to shift in colour in relation to his current
mood, ranging from dark reds to lustrous greens and even black.  His
vertical slit eyes emotionlessly take in all that enter his chamber,
weighing their wants and needs and providing it with rarely a HISSSS
or answer.  {x

{DArrayed in the best of armors, the goblin is bedecked as if for
battle.  Judging from his physical attributes, it is fairly clear that
he didn't construct any of the armor or weaponry himself.  From the
wicked glint in his large yellow eyes, it would not be far from the
truth to say that he stole them and took credit, if workers at the
forge not visible.  Skuttlebum is known for his more deprived
appetites within the Order, a consistant visitor of the Vestry of
Depravity.  The gapped toothed grin seems to indicate he isn't willing
to leave the urges in the Vestry.  {x

~
{DA rare beast in these realms, but held in high esteem by the
members of the Order for its scavenging nature.  The small reptile is
covered in burnished golden scales.  A large copper colored crest
bristles from the top of the head and runs the length of a sinuous
neck.  Large leathery wings support the beast in the air, its whole
form undulating like a massive winged serpent.  The beast has but two
legs, much like a wyvern.  The bite of a jhereg is extremely
poisonous, delivered by row upon row of stiletto shaped fangs.  Golden
eyes betray an extreme intelligence within its small form, caution in
dealing with the beast would be recommendable.  {x

{DFattened off the multitude of undead and traitors cast to its
waiting tusks, the pit boar never seems to be appeased.  Tusks longer
than a man's arm gnash before its porcine face.  Needle-sharp whiskers
bristle from head to toe upon the elephant-sized beast.  Its skin is a
boney dappled colour.  Though the creature seems to be astonishingly
near-sighted, its keen sense of smell negates any advantage its victim
could possibly have down here.  Multiple slashes and scars criss-cross
across its form, testament to the considerable number of battles the
boar has fought, and clearly won.  {x

pens and kennels are embedded within the bone-encrusted walls, secured
by wrought-iron bars.  The smell of carrion and decay is pervasive,
drawing clouds of bitemes and flys in loud BUZZing clouds.  The
maniacal laughter of the Order mounts echo across the expanse,
answered by challenging beasts housed on the opposite wall.  The
kennel is used by the Order as a 'stable' of sorts, though the beasts

torment can be seen throughout, all currently within use.  Hopeless
eyes peer from the eyeslits of an iron maiden.  A small figure shrieks
with each CREAKing crank of a wheel connected to ropes to each of his
limbs as they are slowly and methodically desocketed.  A mad eyed form
SQUEELS as drop after slow drop of icey water falls between his eyes,
thrashing against the restraints that bind him under an iron water
tank.  A splayed form groans from the face of a spinning wheel.  The
devices and implements are countless.  Hooks, chains, garrotes,
brands, blades, any means of torture thinkable is used here, and to
great effect.  Any secret the Order wishes to obtain, will be
obtained.  {x {DA magical mirror rests upon the wall, displaying the outer

encompass and house the entire membership easily and with comfort, if

covered in murals dedicated to the many faces of death.  There are no
religious ceremonies conducted here, no altars to gods, for Death
comes for all and waits for none.  Within these walls there is only
the study and enjoyment of the process of death, whether long
suffering, or short and abrupt, diseased or of old age, tortured or
self-inflicted.  Death is an artform, the Order are its Savants. 
Here, the Order may be replenished and made ready for their next
calling, should they themselves even wake again, for Death comes for

Carcasses are strewn about the room with little care or concern,
clearly used for unspeakable designs.  Fresh bodies have been
collected and stripped of usable flesh, presumably to feed those of
the Order that prefer to feast upon carrion.  Very little concern or
care is shown to the remains left in this area, as if the Order
considers those found here to be deserving of disrespect and dishonor.
Antechambers provide privacy for those seeking 'alone' time with the
corpse of their choosing.  Carrion eaters skitter from body to body,
gorging.  Bleached bones are arrayed in crude positions for the
comical enjoyment of the more baneful members of the Order.  {x

some unknown or unseen race.  Rusty shackles and manacles rattle
quietly as carrion eaters cavort amid the strewn trash and detritus
left about the dungeon floor.  Astonishingly there are no implements
of torture contained herein, for it seems the Order treats this place
simply as a holding area until the next torment device is open for

reformation through captivity, seeing the only true means of
extracting justice as torture and death, hence a sole cell seems to be
more than enough for the prisoners that are taken in.  A message is

cackle
mob echo $I casually throws a raw bit of flesh into the slavering jaws of a nearby hyena, then watches gleefully as others in the pack jump the beast to fight over scraps.

mob echo $I glances at the beasts in the nearby cages, almost affectionately.
say {DThe key is to keep them well fed... of course, they are always hungry so that is nearly impossible.  Best to just let them kill what they want... when they want.{x

mob echo $I digs voraciously through his own snout for lost treasure before noticing the interruption.

mob echo $I proudly holds up a decayed corpse which he obviously scrounged from the nearby Vestry.
say {GSkeezerlo make sure is only best!{x
mob echo $I sniffs at the carcass in ecstasy, ignoring the rancid bits that slough off and the flaking maggots falling like snow.
