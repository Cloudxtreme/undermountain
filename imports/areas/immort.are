The NewsKeeper is here, sleeping on a bed of papers

You notice that this man is probably a bum off the
road. His body is unclean and his face unshaven.  The grays in his hair is
very visible as is in his scruffy beard. He snores loudly, obviously not
doing a very god job of tidying this place from the looks of it. He grubles
and groans in his sleep and turns over, leaving his back to face you.

reeks of the smell of...  Dog.  There are stuffed heads of various past
kills, and in the center of the room, a very large stuffed cat carcass.  In
the corner is a small bed with ripped sheets and covered with dirt.  You
look more closely at the bed and see small rubber squeaky toys under the
bed.  You open the fridge and treat yourself to a nice doggie biscuit. 
Showing on the televison are reruns of Lassie.

'Mobaar's Comedy Relief' written on it.As you enter, you see 
popular stars like Whoopie Goldberg and The Blues Brothers

You then feel like throwing all of your money at him, but 
then he says 'Save it for the Homeless.'  So you do.
Mobaar appears to be a nice gentle man, and he is very 
nice to all that are nice to him.
His entertainment is playing improv jazz on his trumpet.

A huge chandelier made of a unique crystal design is hanging at the
ceiling high above you.  The room itself is inlaid with crystalized
portraits of lost and victorious adventurers of the past.  An altar stands
along the northern wall with two candles and a picture of a unfamiliar face.
The smell of incense is smelt around you with strange green smoke stenching
the chamber.  A huge fur-like circular-shaped rug is placed in the central
part of the room with a logo of a huge "R" and Rzarecta's visage engraved upon
it.  Strange statues of a warrior, priest, mage, thief, ranger and druid
furnish the surroundings of the room as an exhibit to visitors.  To the east
are grand portraits of the immortals of Waterdeep.  A special portrait is
layed from where you came from of Celestia.  The room itself is enchanting
with a strange tone of soothing music heard around you..  Soothing your
chaotic mind momentarily.  A stairway of sort descends from here into..??

Celestia's Room~
~
This is where the boundaries of fantasy and reality collide. Where dawn gently
persuades the moon and stars to sleep beneath their blanket of darkness as she takes
their place to greet the world. The softest of pinks, 
oranges, purples, yellows, whites, and blues paint the sky with their brilliance. In
the distance a stairway of clouds descend to the unknown. Winged horses frolicking
around an enchanted waterfall add to the feeling of 
tranquillity this place offers. Below the cloud-covered floor of this room can be seen
all of the country and her mortal creations. Up here, above the clouds is where
Celestia Aurora comes to relax and watch over all mortals. One step 
in this room fills even the angriest of souls with peace. Love invades and heals your
tortured heart, and as you turn to leave, a gentle breeze caresses your cheek and
whispers softly, You are forgiven...

completely unadorned, save for the hugs silver hoop that hangs in the center
of the four walls.  The shining metal glitters in the light, and you notice
hundreds of tiny glyphs have been etched onto their smooth surface.  Within
the confines of the silver, the blackness is deeper and colder than any you
have ever witnessed.  From these shadows you feel a strange pull, an odd
desire to see what lies on the other side....
