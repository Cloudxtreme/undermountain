seivestatue~
Here stands a dark drow elf, his arms crossed, and feet spread at
shoulder length.  His powerful stance can only hint at his true
strength.  This then, is Seive Sorannon, {8Sil{wen{Wt S{wha{8dow{x.  Not a
physically imposing man, his glowing white pupil-less eyes radiate
intelligence, power, and knowledge.  A plaque near his feet reads "{WTo
Sharp my Heart and Soul: Love conquers all{x".  
~
E
ramonstatue~
A human figure about six feet and five inches stands here.  His
skin is an odd shade of {rmaroon{x.  This is Ramon, crazy Hispanic
Assassin of the {8Shadow Thieves{x.  He wears his signature {Yyellow
{xsombrero on his head, and holds an ever-burning cigarette in one hand
and a {rfire {xopal in the other.  A plaque at his feet reads "{WTo the
memory of Squeaky, Rest in Peace{x".

Here stands an unremarkable figure wearing the robes of a wizard. 
Something about his dark {bblue {xeyes seems familiar...  Yes, of course. 
This is Arek, {8Sh{wad{Wow {WAs{wsas{8sin{x, and devout worshipper of {8Mask{x.
Countless foes have looked into his dark, intelligent eyes right
before feeling the cold touch of Death.  
~
E
viwrathestatue~
A large man stands here holding an ancient blade emanating pure
power.  His eyes, although unmoving, seem to stare directly at you,
piercing your very soul.  Although powerfully built, he seems to
retain extraordinary quickness and agility.  This is Viwrathe
O'Kartha, {8Sh{wad{Wow{wlo{8rd{x, and oldest remaining {8Shadow Thief{x.

gauntleted hand rests on the pommel of his blade, and the other holds
a helmet loosely at waist level.  His face contains unremarkable
features, save for a faint {rreddish{x glow in his eyes.  His hair is
short, but unkempt, and a chain can be seen disappearing under his
armor.  Gaze upon Malus, loyal Gladiator of the {8Shadow Thieves{x.

Here stands the oddest looking creature you've ever encountered. 
Covered from the waist down in a thick auburn fur, his legs are
contorted backwards as a goat.  Two small horns protrude out of his
otherwise human shaped skull.  This is Sargonist O'Kartha, infamous
Satyr and {rpet {xof the famed O'Kartha family.  Sargonist stands giving a
perpetual {Cflirty {xwink, and {Csheepish {xgrin...  Oh my, what is that {Rlarge

laerkai power presense~
As you focus on the presense, a thundering voice booms through your
skull:

	          Forged in Fury,
                  Tempered with Justice,
	          Sharpened by Pain,
	          Silenced in Stealth,
	          Strengthened by Might,
	          And bound in Life.

	       D'lan Treviki Drakyri Laerkai

{*  {*|{x  a single letter to be represented by multiple         {*  {*|{x

{*  {*|{x  However, with such a complex cipher and such a large  {*  {*|{x

{*  {*|{x  The failure with this cipher is that they need so many{*  {*|{x

{*  {*|{x  Because of their widespread but secretive nature, the {*  {*|{x

{*  {*|{x  Frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of   {*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.  It is a{*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  method used in breaking ciphers.                      {*  {*|{x

{*  {*|{x  The basic idea is to examine the characters in the    {*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  ciphertext and determine the frequency that each one  {*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  occurs. So just count up how many times a specific    {*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  letter appears in the encrypted text. Then, using an  {*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  understanding of commonly occurring letters, one can  {*  {*|{x
{*  {*|{x  make educated guesses about the ciphertext.           {*  {*|{x

{*  |{x  Before any battle can begin, it is imperative for a   {*  |{x
{*  |{x  successful army to know themselves and to know their  {*  |{x
{*  |{x  opponent. Knowledge of strengths, weaknesses, force,  {*  |{x
{*  |{x  and location is called foresight.                     {*  |{x

{*  |{x  To have foresight is to have victory. A victorious    {*  |{x
{*  |{x  army always wins first, and then seeks battle.        {*  |{x

{*  |{x  To lack foresight is to see defeat. A wise army knows {*  |{x
{*  |{x  when to fight and when not to fight.                  {*  |{x
{*  |{x                                                        {*  |{x
{*  |{x  For an army to know the opponent, the army must       {*  |{x
{*  |{x  understand both his strengths and his weaknesses. To  {*  |{x
{*  |{x  be able to change and adapt to exploit this knowledge {*  |{x

{*  |{x                                                        {*  |{x
{*  |{x  Knowledge of force and location is vital to success.  {*  |{x
{*  |{x  To discover this information is key. Therefore, to    {*  |{x

{*  |{x  Foresight leads to victory. But without illusion, the {*  |{x

{*  |{x  To overcome the minds of the opponent, the victor must{*  |{x

{*  |{x  Play the fool to capture a fool. Deck the tree with   {*  |{x

{*  |{x  An army that waits for the opponent is well rested and{*  |{x
{*  |{x  eager. An army that travels to the opponent is weary  {*  |{x
{*  |{x  and hungry. Thus, the rested army will see victory.   {*  |{x

{*  |{x  A victorious army will always force the opponent to   {*  |{x
{*  |{x  come to him. If the opponent is entrenched, go not to {*  |{x

{*  |{x  To gain added advantage, remove the ladder when the   {*  |{x

{*  |{x  isolated and on poor ground.                          {*  |{x
{*  |{x                                                        {*  |{x
{*  |{x  Whenever possible, kill with a borrowed knife. This   {*  |{x

{*  |{x  When outright combat is necessary, the true shadow will {*|{x

{*  |{x  When entering the field of battle, always enter with  {*  |{x

of Westbridge. The ground is lightly covered in white sand, and huge
torches cast long shadows along the walls. In the center of the room,
a large granite podium rises from the ground, bearing the seal of the
Shadow Thieves. Secret tunnels and passageways lead out in every direction
from the Commons, helping the Thieves to complete their daily routines

of water echoing faintly off the walls. Illuminated by some unknown light

barren. Massive doors of solid stone, reinforced with bands of shadowsteel,
are locked tight to prevent unwanted guests. Beyond that, there are no

Deep within the confines of the {8Shadow Thieves {xLair lies this
comfortably sized chamber.  It is the sanctuary and retreat of the
most fabled of all the Legends of this ancient guild.  Even the most
trusted members of the Thieves do not enter this alcove without a good
purpose.  Viwrathe O'Kartha has undeniably earned far more than a
modest room for his personal use, but he wants and needs only a quiet
place for undisturbed reflection and peace.  Marvelous weapons line
the walls, but the room is furnished with but a small bed and
nightstand.  The chamber is dominated by a large circle carved into
the marble floor, used for meditation.

appears to be the sanctuary of the Elder Thief. Mahogany bookshelves

by the directed beams of mystical orbs, is a full sized depiction of
the dagger and mask, symbol of the family.{x
