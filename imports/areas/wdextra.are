{RD{wu{rrn{wa{Rn{x, the innkeeper stands at the reception desk.
~
This human towers above most others, with a large disproportionate
frame that would be menancing for most wanting to cause trouble here. 
He looks to be very old, the deep wrinkles accentuating his dark
leathery skin.  His hair is white, and thinning, and he wears a strong
beard, neatly trimmed.  He seems to be in good health, serving the
customers with haste and a hearty laugh.

the guild, yet his duty now is to speak for the affairs of the
governing guildhouse here in Waterdeep, rather than teach his trade to
others.  In other words, he's a politician now.

The {yD{woo{yrw{8a{yrd {xof {YH{yaw{Yk{Wwi{Cn{wt{Ce{Wr {MV{milla{x stands here.
~
He is middle aged, a man of tall build and greying hair.  He wears
an outrageous coned hat, reminiscent of a wizard's head gear, though
even the least respectable of wizards wouldn't be caught in this
thing.  His dress robes are tassled and inset with many fine details. 
He carries a foldable canopy, commonly called an "umbrella" in the
greater realms, though he uses it more as a cane than protection from
the elements.  In some instances, he also uses it as a weapon, and no
matter your lot in life, this man seems to be able to hold his own in
a fight.

The {CL{cord {YH{yaw{Yk{Wwi{Cn{wt{Ce{Wr{x stands here, mulling over his recent deeds.
~
The patriarch of this Hawkwinter villa is an elder noble of the
city of splendors, dressed modestly in light robes and a sash.  He is
elderly, but very fit, as age has treated him well, only painting a
strip of white down his head and beard.  His eyes are somewhat inset,
but gives him an almost handsome quality, accented by his thick brow
and well-defined jawbone.  He takes to guests very well, though he
also relishes in his privacy--a fact which comes through upon finding
him in solitude among his thoughts.

magician's sash about his waist--suggesting he is also a learned mage,
as only a magic user can wear these.  He looks up, very calmly and
offers an inviting smile.

The {Mr{megistrar {xof {Gg{guild {Ra{rffairs{x is here.
~
He is a burly kenku, put in charge of registering all applicants
seeking guild membership.  He wears a monocle that magnifies one of
his deep yellow eyes.  His back is hunched beneath a tight fitting
suite.  Upon closer inspection, it appears he prefers to tuck his
wings behind him, perhaps to better fit in with the city.  Indeed
finding a kenku in these parts is uncommon.  Finding a kenku in a city
office of Waterdeep is rare indeed.

The {ypastry {Wchef{x works over a flour-covered table.
~
He is middle-aged, plump and red in the face, as perhaps years of
drinking the finest spirits of the City of Spendors can do to a man. 
He takes to his trade very well, kneading and tossing at the flour
dough, which rises rather poorly this close to the shore, and takes on
a somewhat bitter taste.  Yet for fine pastries and baked goods, this
baker's work is well liked by the locals.

He is tall and somewhat lanky, with rather pronounced facial
features.  A large nose and forward protruding front teeth gives him
an almost comical look, though his formal guild attire goes a long way
in restoring his stature.  He wears a multi-folding monocle glass
about his neck--a common tool of lapidarists and appraisers.  His is
unique in that inset within it is a glowing gemstone, that gives out
its own light to help see the gemstones he appraises day in and day
out.  Though he seems harmless enough, his rather forced smile
suggests he has been doing this a long time.

his trade: many spring tweezers, loops, holding clips, and mirrors to
redirect light across the gemstones.  He seems very busy, but
appraising is his bread and butter, so he is more than forthcoming in
offering his services.

tweezers, picks, and small hammers for listening to the sound quality

Preaching joy in death these death-like projections of Kelemvor are here

fifteen.  A stage has been built into the northern wall here where an array
of musical instruments have been set up - courtesy of the inn - for any
traveling minstrels or anyone who feels confident enough to show off some
talent.  To the east you can see dim haze that looks like the pub, and to
the south is the reception desk for checking in and out of rooms.

From the inn, this seems to be a secret little garden set off aside the
road.  To the west are hedges that tower about 12 feet high and are too
thick to see clearly through.  It is obvious the main road is to the west
due to all the voices and clammer going on from that direction.  Around you
is a single well built into the center of this forgotten garden.  Ivy
mysteriously creeps around the well and spreads throughout the stone floor
and walls which gives it an eerie look, almost as if it calls you explore
it's dark depths.  A large bucket dangles from a rope that is suspended by a
metal rod in the well.  Oddly enough, even with the aging of the well, the
rope and rod look quite sturdy and safe if one were to descend themselves
into the shadows of the well.

The stairs break their pattern here as a hallway leads north to the
first four rooms of the Inn.  The walls, floors and stairs here look
very poorly treated, but ancient, and worn with time.  At one time
this place looked magnificent, and now have been left to age to show
that indeed it is the oldest inn of Waterdeep.  The style of these
rooms has not swayed the Inn's business though.  This is still an inn
that never sleeps.

In the Sewers~

The sewers are dark, damp and smelly--pretty much like all sewers,
though the Waterdeep sewers are markedly easier to walk through due to
the sheer size of them.  Large sewers are necessary for transporting
the huge volumes of waste that the people of the city generate each
day.  This is not a pleasant place to be by far.  The sewers continue
west, while to the east, the broken section of wall leads back to the
bottom of the well.

to eat.  An old rug sits on the hard wood floor, and a gaudy lamp
hangs from the center ceiling.  Several pictures are hung up about the
room depicting different scenes of Waterdeep City.  One shows a dragon
standing atop Mount Waterdeep looking out over the harbor, while
another is a scene of the Plinth in a religious celebration.

This room has all the standard furnishings: a bed, a fireplace and
a chair, though extra effort has gone into adding some otherwise
unneeded decorations, such as twin candleholders along the far wall,
and several crudely drawn and colored pictures that depict various
scenes in Waterdeep.  One picture shows a generic looking noble villa,
with the wrought iron fench and two ugly gargoyles at the gate, while
another depicts a great Court where several mercenaries seem to be
standing about in idle watch.

An inscription sits engraved on the wall by some unknown hand:
{x
{c Some come for the tales of deeds done, battles won, no tale twice the same. 
{c But things are done for less lofty aims, treachery as wicked as the drow's shame, 
{c Unhallowed gods are praised, grizzly rites carried out to praise their name, 
{c On shores of Sargauth River, underworld city of Skullport thrives from pirates' gain,
{c Where slaves are bought and sold, some for work, some for food, all in pain, 
{c 'Ware least in the glooms, vampires feast on your doom as vein wine they drain,{x

The entrance of the Church of Ever Mystery is legendary that most in
Faerun who have not seen it in person cannot even imagine. Beautiful
tapestries of Mystran heroes adorn its fine wooden walls as mystical
illusions made by the lady's dweomerkeepers make them move in visage
and feat. An ancient jade mist dragon seems to fly as it becomes the
decorum of the roof carvings. The entry hall is a moving masterpiece
of art and magic in all forms and comprehensions. A stacking staired
stage rises up to an altar, where high priests speak in the one true
spell, as a pillar of arcane light shoots upward through the occulus
into the heavens. At the back are two ancient doors with carvings of
the Lady and all her radiance, the radiance spreading out across the
whole of the temple, basking worshippers in echoes of the very Weave.

A temple is hidden away here within the confines of the Trollwall,
as worship to Talos is oftentimes frowned upon by the citizens of the
city.  The temple is small and in disarray, though respectable
destruction, as cracked walls and a shattered altar stand as
testaments to the power of Talos.  Along the walls, are murals
depicting destruction in its many facets: the sinking of ships to
great tides, the burning of a forest to fire, the devestation of a
city perhaps due to a natural disaster.  All of these images seek to
instill fear to newcomers and strangers to Talosian tradition, while
offering inspiration to the disciples of destruction.

Led by the Loremaster Most High, Sandrew the Wise, Savant of Oghma, this
temple has bloomed into a vast library of ancient and modern texts.  A large
fountain circles the middle of this temple as large marble benches surround
the fountain.  Rolling ladders connected to the grand bookshelves allow
sages such as yourself to go up and down the bookshelves and delve farther
into there history.  Modeled much like the lost Edificant Library it is a
very beautiful sight.  With fine stain glass made from the Mulhorandi
denizens, huge heroes of wisdom filter the light.  The Loremaster Sandrew
has done a grand job with the temple.

The street curves a wide path about this tower, as its wide turrets
shadow it below.  Around the tower are placed many trinkets, ornate
but of little value, fashioned of wood and clay, and painted to the
likenesses of gold and platinum.  These anonymous offerings are placed
here quickly by passerbys to bring luck to their daily routine; where
a visit to the altar waiting in the lines for Lady Luck's blessing is
not practical, a quick offering here is the next best thing.  The
clergy of the Tower of Luck allow a full day for luck to show before
cleaning the grounds.  The entrance to the tower is up a wide set of
stairs.

The shop here is extremely clean and tidy.  Over four torches line each
wall of this store which makes it very bright - almost too bright.  Along
the walls where there aren't any torches though, are some of the most
gorgeous and intricately made paintings of the city of Waterdeep that you
have ever seen.  Each portrays a still life of some of the hot spots in the
city.  One painting is of the Waterdeep Baazar, another of the City of Dead,
and another of Waterdeep City from the wonderful viewing perspective of
Mount Waterdeep.  Due to all the wonderful painting, one would think this
building an art gallery, but it is not.  Up at the counter here is a large
pile of catalogues to all the sites and shops in Waterdeep!

Randomly placed about are tables for people who wish to chat, deal
with herbal remedies, or just sit quietly in the aromtic and soothing
incense.  To the back is a counter at which some herbal samples and
other healing implements have been placed for applying remedies to
patients.  Behind the counter is a solid oak door frame that leads
into the inner sanctums of this guild.  Entrance inside is restricted
to those of the clerical arts who hold honorable memberships to the
guild, meaning they shelled out their dues in gold.

boasts a generous use of large stones, excavated at the nearby shorelines that
suggests the first part of this villa was built many centuries ago long before
the decree against mining and foresting within the city holdings was made. The
latter displays metal and cloths, giving a warming, more lighthearted style to
this otherwise baroque structure.  Still, its size and place at the end of the
street suggests it is home to one of the most respected noble families in town.

This wide, open room is a meeting place for the guildsmen of the
House of Crystal--the headquarter building for the Guild of
Glassblowers, Glaziers, and Speculum-Makers, and also a source of fine
crystal balls and mirrors.  A long table spans across the darkness,
with several chairs scattered about it.  Along the walls are crates of
raw materials and many display cases housing some of the finest
examples of glass and crystal in all the realms.  Surprisingly there
is no one here to guard this room, and no provisions seem to have been
made to protect what is inside.

The tower opens into a massive, round room, encompassing the entire
breadth of the tower's first floor.  A gradual slope upward on all
sides creates a domed floor where at the center rises a spiral
staircase.  Several sealed doors line the walls at every corner of a
compass rose adorning the floor.  This is the headquarters of the
Watchful Order, a governing organization for regulating the use of
magic in civilized life.  It is this group that the city often turns
to in their magical deficiencies, and the Order has enjoyed great
success as an officially recognized establishment of noteworthy mages
and wizards.

This vast temple has been built from solid stone with marble
sections embedded in half sections for decoration.  Rivaling
some of the more established temples in Waterdeep the Plinth
is near unique in concept:  No one who worships a recognized
deity of the realms is turned away as this temple is devoted
to all recognized immortal deities of the realms.  Six large
pillars of marble hold up the center arch, from which floods
light down to the floor below through a wide occulus that is
open to a chamber of light. Along the perimeter of the floor
are placed worshipping booths with statues and altars of all
recognized dieties.  The only rule being that no disorder is
tolerated and no intelligent beings are to be sacrificed. An
array of guards stand watch constantly over the Plinth.  The
central occulus of light also serves as a natural wind organ,
resonanting the temple in a deep tone by the wind of the sea.{x

When a party is on, the sounds of conversation, laughter and music

brightly colored banners hanging from arched windows and corner eaves
adorned with large stone gargoyles.  A doorward stands at the bottom

The ballroom is perhaps one of the most lavish of all rooms in the
Hawkwinter manor, with several large windows opening to the east,
floor to ceiling, in the traditional arched style as found in castles.
Between each, large tapestries bought from faraway lands hang, and
silk streamers bounce along the high ceiling, which spans to the top
of the second floor.  A makeshift balcony is built at the top west,
where onlookers from the second floor can look down at the
festivities.  This room replaces the great hall of castles, and is
just as elegant, scaled down to fit in this small estate.  At the
north end, the wall is closed off, and there sits the lord and
family's dias and feast table, though it is more for looks than
anything else as Hawkwinter modesty is known far and wide, show or
not.

A modest stage sits across the room, which opens to the ballroom to
the north, separated only by large curtains which is almost rarely

a psaltry, a lute, and trumpets of varying sizes.  Though entertainers
are often courted for the lavish parties held here, it is commonplace
to have guests and even Lord Hawkwinter himself try their hand at one
of these instruments.  Results vary but can fall anywhere from
moderately pleasant to incredibly loud and annoying.  In any capacity,
the guests will be entertained.

The south end of the villa opens to a wide window overlooking the
courtyard, though it cannot be accessed here.  Instead, a wide
staircase winds upward, about a gargoyled post and up a vinelike rail
atop grandiloquent stemmed banisters.  A large tapestry depicting the
sword and shield of the Hawkwinter clan is hung above the window, and
several portraits line the walkway upward.  The staircase leads up to
the library and parlor, and also to the private chambers of the
patrons of Hawkwinter villa.

The western edge of the veranda looks out onto the streets, as many
passerbys gaze up at your vantage point, some seemingly in envy.  The
veranda is fashioned with miniature crowned towers as banisters, rich
maplewood railing adorned with blackened iron studs, and planked with
thick timbers, which are normally exclusive to support beams and
shipwrights.  Several chairs are here, for guests to chat and look out
onto the streets, enjoying their position for the evening while
sipping on the finest beverage the high life has to offer.

This dining room spans north and south, with several segmented
tables at the center.  To the far wall is the serving platform, and to
the near wall, small basins and towels.  The walls are lined in
mirrors, giving the illusion of a vast room, though it is still very
large without.  Banners and dress mannequins lie along the narrow
spots between mirror panels, and three chandeliers hang down from the
tall, arched ceiling.  To the north, three paneled windows rise floor
to ceiling, offering a view past the veranda and out to the city.

ferment.  Larger racks hold up barrels, some tapped with spigots to be

where ice cold water runs, providing the cooling for the room.  To the

and along the walls are hung many portraits of some of the most
prominent figures of the city.  Here along this walk of fame, one can
see the likenesses of Lord Lhestyn, Khelben Arunsun, Piergeiron and
Captain Rulathon.  Others are here that are not readily recognizable
and still yet, there are blank places on the wall where stories have
yet to be told.  To the east, a door leads into one of the bedrooms,

weaponry, as the library is as much a display area as it is a
repository for knowledge.  Lighting is provided by globed oil lamps,
carefully caged in black iron and hooded soot collectors to protect
the books.  To the south the room opens to a lounging area, set up
with cushioned chairs and a bar.

oils lies behind the privy seat, masking any odors which result from
its use.  A small wash basin sits at the opposite wall, lit with
candles.  The privy opens commonly to the north and south rooms,
though the door system is elaborately constructed such that if one
turns the locking latch on one, others also turn, closing off all
doors at once.

This house is fashioned completely from stone, as it is named. 
While many other buildings in Waterdeep are stone, this one is the
only one to be completely of stone, including doors, flooring, and
furniture.  Because of the burden of opening and closing the large
rollaway stone doorway, this house is open most of the time for public
view.  It is uncertain why it is here, or what its purpose serves, but
in any case, it is yet another curious facet of this vast city.

one another. Several pillars of stone rise up to hold the upper levels, in
each is carved depictions of fruits and intertwined vinework in a stylized
motif. Within each pillar is set a torch bracket, where an oil torch hangs
and illuminates the room.  The light creeps deep into shadowed corners and
far reaches, faintly illuminating a large stone slab table, and further at
the back, an elaborate spiral stairway that spins around a support pillar.

An {8Old {yWarehouse{x~
~
This small, dimly lit warehouse is full of over-ripened fruits and
vegetables.  Flies swarm the entire room and have taken it over due to
the mass quantity of spoiled rotten food.  The wooden walls have been
bored into by some kind of insects, making their home within the
boards.  A sign hangs just above the door frame here and says "Pig
Slop"

Warehouse~
~
This large warehouse probably toweres about thirty feet high, but due to
the lack of light that even your light source emits, you cannot really tell.
It is however, tightly stocked by numerous crates of all sizes and looks
like it is used for storage.  Oddly though, each crate looks to be in mint
condition and each one is stamped with the name of "Bellister" upon them. 
Besides the crates, nothing else inhabits this warehouse - aside from the
occasional mouse and dusty floors of course.

Here lies the most prominent - and truthful - newsgroup out in
Waterdeep.  Unfortunately, due to their pursue of the truth, the
building does not get much support or help.  Large complex machinery
line the walls and fill the center of the room here with half printed
broadsheets, fully edited newspapers, and sketches and pictures of
certain topics.  A large {ysign{x hangs from the ceiling here as well, and
screams for a visitor's attention.  As the machines reel and spin,
every hour of the day, a smell of ink and heated broadsheet paper has
consumed the building and all its inhabitants.  A fine layer of dust
has also accumulated on the old wooden floors.  This certainly isn't
the cleanliest of places, but it sure dishes out a nice newspaper.

Inside this large building is equally vast as its outside.  Large
spires hold up a stone ceiling, where many chandeliers hang.  The
stonemasons who worked these walls did so with utmost care.  Relief
carvings depicting city life in Waterdeep is on high, granite panels
set within the walls.  An impressive collection of books, scrolls,
charts and maps sits behind inlaid quartz bookcases that lie along the
south wall.  At the center of the room is a curving desk, beautifully
carved from mohagony and inlaid in burntwillow and aspen.  The mosaic
work on the floors depict the city seal and motto "The Open City"
suggesting the freedom that Waterdeep offers to the guilds.  Indeed
there are benefits to governing guilds, as their many gifts adorn this
otherwise dull interior.  A large {Gsign {xhangs here, detailing the list

The upper level of the House of Healing is breathtaking: With all
four walls near completely lined in windows, lavishly adorned with ten
foot drapes that weigh perhaps as much as an average human.  The half
domed ceiling is adorned with golden stars and globes to suggest the
divine implications of their practice.  At the center of the room are
rows of examination tables, for students and members to hone their
arts.  Several apothecary stations lie at the far end of the room. 
The floor is lined in mosaic icons and special drains have been added
to aid in cleaning up blood spillage.  A whisp of incense floats
about, otherwise masking the rather pungent odor of decay.

adorned with many tapestries depicting famous uses of magic.  From
left to right are scenes of the battle of the Court of the White Bull,
the banishing of Halaster into Undermountain, the great battle of
Midnight and Cyric atop Blackstaff Tower, and another unknown battle
of great magnitude atop a burning mass of fire.  At the center of the

took over two years total to make.  The tables have been fashionably
designed straight from pure glass, and the illumination for the inn is
emitted by a dozen or so, flashy lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  A
counter to the east, which looks to be solid oak, has been sanded down
and stained a golden brown to give it a richness in look.  A set of

guests and visitors gather to eat, drink and lull away the evenings in
each other's company.  Though the Unicorn Horn doesn't boast a wide
selection of accomidations, their suites are among the best in
Waterdeep for elegance and comfort.  Several quaint tables sit strewn
about the commons as a waitress wanders by taking orders and filling
drinks.  The south wall is lined in windows, which offers a grand view
of the royal gardens and the rich slopes of Mount Waterdeep.  To the
north, the commons ends at the entrance to the three suites.

doors to the east and west are grand double oak panels, adorned with
brass fixtures and bearing the insignia of the Unicorn's Horn inn
establishment.  Two round tapestries adorn the floor at the entrance
to each, which boasts a full service latrine, food and libation
service to guests.  To the north is a lavishly decorated set of doors
that dwarves the two on either side.  The deep red stained wood is
carved in relief with images of unicorns and sprites above a star
filled sky.  Above the door is a gold foil depiction of a unicorn
bust, with its horn shining brightly in mirrored metal casting.  A

Mount Waterdeep rises along the right, while below it sits the likes
of Waterdeep Castle and Piergeiron's Palace.  A clean line traces from
the castle to a large circle in the street, offset by many squares
littered about.  Another oval shaped open area seems to move by
itself, as masses of people gather in the Bazaar to trade and
interact.  A large mage's tower blocks the view to the far left, where
the mooring bells can be heard.  Far to the right, elegant temple
complexes rise above noble villas.

This large room is bigger than most bedrooms, though this one is
devoted entirely to a bath and latrine.  Such a concept is almost
unheard of outside noble villas and castles.  Several large wood
panels are inset within the walls, displaying relief carvings of
angelic beings descending down to bath happy patrons.  A few depict
more licentious scenes of debauchery, which no doubt happens here on
occasion.  The large, warm water bath basin is indeed large enough for
four.  The latrine closet is opened to the room, and a wash basin
stand sits nearby, to facilitate good hygiene.  It seems that no
expense was spared in bringing together some of the conveniences of
what would otherwise be considered a mundanely functional area.

This lower level room is fashioned with curving walls, seemingly
perfect in geometry.  The stones are uniquely cut to interlock with
those nearby, allowing scarcely the thickness of a camel's hair
between.  The surface is smooth, polished and devoid of imperfections.
Several torchlights hang at intervals, setting black teardrop of soot
across the wall and ceiling.  At the center of the room is a round
table, intersected by four support pillars which create a narrow
platform within from which a single person can stand and address the
congregation.  Many chairs are set up about the room, but only twelve
around the table, reserved for the guild masters and elders of the

You walk into a high ceiling building, separated by a vast open
area from entrance to end.  Robed scholars walk about talking and
comparing writings and ideas, while along the walls several apprentice
scriveners attend to their daily lessons.  Several squared support
pillars divide the room roughly into thirds, reserving the largest
divide to the center area.  Many artistic renderings and calligraphy
of ancient mottos hang about the pillars and side walls.  The most
striking and quizzical feature of all is the blank wall that stands
two stories across the room, at the far end.  Several occular openings
illuminate the wall, which appears as a smooth, barren slab of stone. 
Many people about marvel and point at it as if they see something in
it, yet it appears there is nothing there.  A stairway down and north
of here leads to another area.

This long underground room is the gathering place for the Splendid

are many display cases showing off the mastery works of former and
current guild members, representing some of the finest works known in
this region.  They are here as a testament to what mortal ingenuity
can do, and serve as a teaching tool for apprentices in the guild. 
The walls are simple wood planks, joined with interlocking hourglass
shaped iron braces.  Not surprising, the doors that lead to the
private chambers of the guild elders are set with intricate locking
mechanisms, some boasting as many as ten tumblers.  The ceiling is
low, but bows upward at its center so that taller individuals can feel
more comfortable here.  Above, one can hear the sounds of walking and
talking, suggesting this room lies beneath a public place.

street fashioned from timbers to provide level ground for passengers
and cargo.  Dozens of smaller vessels crowd in where the waters are
shallow, taking advantage of the confusion to unload goods and
stowaways, perhaps without taxation.  All along the dock are stacked
crates, barrels and baggage, some waiting to be loaded, others waiting
for transportation to arrive and take it to a storehouse, while others
still seem to be permanent fixtures on the docks.

{yDock{x~
~
The wide dock of Waterdeep's port continues far out to the harbor. 
Below the salty waters lick the support timbers in their thick crust. 
To the west and south are breathtaking views of the harbor.  The sheer
vastness of the sea is humbling among this city that stands as but a
footprint in the realms.  Far along the horizon, beyond the ship
dotted waters, the freestanding fortification of deepwater harbor can
be seen as a dark line drawn just beneath the horizon.  To the east,
the crowds disembark to a city where dreams will be realized,
shattered, and otherwise created from humbleness.  In all of this,
adventure never strays the journey.

The freestanding dock ends here, as Deepwater Harbor drops to
dizzying depths below.  To the west, the cool blue waters of the
harbor stretch amidst a forest of seafaring vessels, dotting the
horizon like locusts on a voyage of famine.  The dock is perpetually
busy, as ships tie down and release one after another, sometimes
waiting hours for a free spot on the dock to tie down.  The biggest
ships dock here at the deepest points in Waterdeep's harbor, as
passengers and cargo create a sordid mess among the chaos.

The stairs descend into a dimly lit cellar area that is small and
narrowed by an excess of crates, barrels and other sort of containers
stacked to the ceiling along all the walls.  Flickering lamplights
hang from bare rafters at long distances, providing only limited
lighting as the flicker of dust trails fall from the floorboards
above.  The sounds of clanking metal and a voice echoes far down the
passage as a lone spotlight can be seen far off in the room to the
south.  Up returns you back to the locksmith shop.

The {GW{gal{Gk {xof {YM{yaster {WW{works{x~
~
The marble stairway descends into a well lit room, more hallway
than reception area, being long and narrow and connecting two points
here to the south.  Along the walls hang many beautiful works of
armory, metalsculpting, and display cases detailing some of the most
intricate and effective locking mechanisms in all the realms.  This
guild represents practicality of ingenuity.  While many armorers
choose membership in the metalworkers guild, it is here that the guild
employs ingenious innovations in armormaking--jointed segmented plates
that do not bind, and armor that breathes for long journeys in
inhospitable places.  This is also the origin of the now infamous
chastity belts sold throughout the realms.  To the south is a large
hall where guild members gather.

This room is long and narrow, composed of many rows of shelving
where much of the guild's private stock of components are stored.  It
is also here that special guild recipes for healing and recovery are
concocted and sold at a discount to guild members.  A wiry eyed cleric
trained in apothecral arts stands behind the counter selling goods to
the members.  Behind him, a beautiful mural depicting an angelic being
in flight oversees the healing arts performed here and elsewhere in
the hall.

This small room is dedicated to the healing arts, channelling both
magic and skill into healing even the most difficult of injuries.  A
small pulpit stands at the back of the room, where the healing cleric
sells the most powerful of spells.  A list of these spells can be
found on a {Wsign{x which hangs to the left.  A thick curtain separates
this room from the rest of the guildhall.  Dimly lit candles and
burning incense helps enhance the healing which is practiced here.

{7The wooden floors and walls creak as the wind from the nearby ocean s

torch light prevails, a few minature models of great ships have been bottled
in glass jugs and set onto display tables as prize collections.  There is
also a large table set here in the center of the room which is around 6 feet
in diameter.  It must be used a lot for gatherings due to the numerouse

The shop here is extremely clean and tidy.  Over four torches line each
wall of this store which makes it very bright - almost too bright.  Along
the walls where there aren't any torches though, are some of the most
gorgeous and intricately made paintings of the city of Waterdeep that you
have ever seen.  Each portrays a still life of some of the hot spots in the
city.  One painting is of the center square of Waterdeep, another of the
Hero's Garden, and another of Castle Waterdeep.  Due to all the wonderful
painting, one would think this building an art gallery, but it is not.  Up
at the counter here is a large pile of catalogues to all the sites and shops
in Waterdeep!

Upon entering this large building, a must...  Almost ashy smell fills
your lungs.  The sounds of a forge and constant hammering can be heard in
the back room where all of the smithys work their hard labor.  Hanging on
the walls are numerous metal odds and ends used as household decorations. 
On the east shelves are some buckets of nails, horseshoes, spikes and
needles.  On the west shelves are a few simple weapons like flails maces and
hammers.  In the center of the room is a small booth where selling, buying,
and trading goes on.  To the north is where the smithies work and lound
clangs of metal can be heard.  Also, a spiral stairway leads up from here to
the second floor.

This guildhall is modest in size, with low lying ceiling and wood
floors, but these details are quickly forgotten upon viewing the
countless rows of display cases, housing examples of nearly every gem
imaginable.  A faint magical aura can be felt and seen over
everything, suggesting powerful magic wards off would be thieves here.
A single person sits within a wraparound counter island at the center
of the room.  He is older, though tall and refined in attire. 
Generous lighting keeps every gemstone kept here sparkling to their
fullest, making for a truly breathtaking sight.

The upstairs room is vastly different than below.  Tall ceilings
and rather ornate looking decorations gives this room a feeling of
wealth.  The western wall is lined in windows, draped in crimson and
blue hangings, and offering a generous view of the royal palace
grounds.  To the north, east and south are other areas where the
appraisals are taken care of.  Above each is a sign which designates
which appraiser handles which gems.

This appraiser's office is larger than the others, comprising of a
low ceiling, but long, cluttered room.  To the back are stacked dusty
furniture that is not being used by the guild.  To the front is a

longer, with several small inset display panels rather than a single
large one.  Two benches sit near it, for patrons of the appraisal
service to sit in wait for the fate of their gems to be decided. 
Behind the counter sits the appraiser, who is an average sized man of
middle age.  Just at the door is posted a {Wsign {xwhich explains more

not for the prices posted on the various "goods" that lie strewn
about.  Piles and piles of crates and boxes line the walls and stack
at the center of the room.  All are dirty, some even having dried
barnacles remaining from seafaring voyages.  Many if not all seem like
secondhand storage containers.  The patron of this shop, Saule, sits
at a makeshift counter and beside him is a somewhat interesting
offering of newer looking containers sure to fit anyone's
organizational needs.

The upstairs of this building houses an old loft area that for many years 
housed the finesmiths and artisans responsible for much of the inventory 
that is sold out of the Hiker's Request. The room is dark and accented 
with old woodwork, bare rafters and leaky ceiling. Workbench style tables 
line the walls and jut out randomly in places. Every square parcel of 
bench space is covered in tools and raw materials. A partially drawn 
curtain at the back of the room reveals a cot and preparation area, suggesting 
this doubles as someone's living space. A few windows look out onto the 
street with single pane, half transparent glass.

part by the city, though significant guild influence is evident throughout. 
The walls are paneled in sheets of fine oak, stained and polished to

small openings remain to allow the bank officials access to the patrons. 
Most transactions are done here in the lobby, though for those requiring
special attention, there is a room in the back available for one on one
appointments for all things financial. The sounds of screaming can be
heard from behind the counter.

say Let me tell you about what I can do:
say There are three powerful pieces of armor from the Lair of Tchazzar.
say All three were bound with a spell, called "revamp" from the Arcane Tome.
say Upon uttering this spell, the lines of recitation burned away from the Tome.
say But the essence of this spell remained in the three pieces:
say The scales from which {8a Suit of {RP{Br{Gi{Cs{Wm{Ra{Bt{Gi{Cc {WD{Rr{Ba{Gg{Co{Wn Scalemail{m is forged{x
say The quickening belt, known as the {RS{rash {mof the {8C{xhosen
say And the cloak of night shadows, known as {8a {YM{8oonlight {WC{8loak{x
say I have the power of bending the arcane spell, and morphing one piece to another!
say The procedure is complicated, taxing, and requires keystone items to initiate.
say And there is a chance of failure: about one in five will fail.
say Not great odds, but enough to deter all but the most dedicated of heroes.
say Now then, if you are interested, I can spell out the details of the {Mprocedure{m.{x

say So, for example, you give me the sash to convert.
say Either a prismatic or a cloak, or charred remains will result.
say That is the limits of my power: Unpredictability and magic go hand and hand.
stare
say When you are ready, give me two things in any order:
say One of the three pieces of Tchazzar equipment.
say And the keystone item: A Cube of Force
say Once you give an item to me, it is mine to keep.
say Do not go changing your mind halfway through.
say Payment will be required when I am finished.
say It will be one thousand platinum coins, regardless of the item.
say So be sure your coinpurse is heavy before you give me anything.

say I can tell you, because you pretty much already know, that they taught me kinetos.
say It was from an arcane tome they brought back from the Lair of Tchazzar.
say But you know, there is another spell in that book.
say The binding spell, the one that makes kinos possible.
say It is called "revamp", and scarcely does a tome exist with it still written within.
say If you want to learn more, first find an arcane tome from Tchazzar's lair.
say Take it to a bookkeeper's assistant in Mist.  The boy is a learned scrivener of arcane text.
say It is a gift those Mistians possess that arcanists like myself envy.
say If he can successfully recover the spell, bring the tome back here and I will help you.
say Good luck!
