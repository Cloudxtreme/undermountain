The stone corridor between the front gates and the gates that
enclose the rest of the compound are barely narrow enough to fit
people through two at a time.  The stone floors have been polished to
a dull shine while the walls are strangely void of any decoration

This is the innermost chamber in the castle it is lit by braziers
in the corners of the room.  There are a few windows looking out over
the courtyard and the walls are covered in tapestries depicting many
famous {RK{rn{8i{&g{8h{rt{Rs{x.  Pushed up against the walls are a few benches to sit
on, while in the center of the room, on a pedestal is what appears to
be the legendary {6S{8h{&ie{8l{6d {8o{&f {RS{ri{&lv{ra{Rm{x.  It is floating about a foot above
