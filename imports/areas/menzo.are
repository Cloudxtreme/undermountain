from seeing into the depths below, but an occasional glimpse of movement
from the corner of your eye reminds you that you are not alone here.  To
your west is a small area of sand, but it is too dark to see past that.  In

Entrance to an Enormous Cavern~
~
You are just inside the entrance to an enormous cavern.  To your west
through a large cave is a vast lake.  To the east is a magnificent city. 
The world around is as dark as the darkest night, yet the city glows with
auras of purples and pinks and pale yellow light.  At least a mile away, is
a large stalacitite, which rises from the ground and stretches hundreds of
feet above to the dark stone ceiling.  With a start, you realize belatedly
that your light is drawing undue attention, and quickly extenguish it,
plunging you into darkness.  When your eyes adjust to the dark, you draw a
sharp breath of air.  In your light, the city was glorious.  Only when seen
as it was built to be, in the darkness of the underdark, however, can you
truly appreciate its subtle splendor.  The pillar in the center of the
cavern is glowing with a dull red aura, brightest around its center.  You
hear scuffling feet to your east, though, and need to move quickly.

You are climbing a very steep path here, and are having trouble keeping
your footing.  Above you are the lights of the city, while beneath you is a
perpendicular passageway.  With a grunt and mental heave, you continue along
your way.

Farther to the west the ground slopes downward, and a large gate bars you

The wall runs east here, where it turns back northward, and continues
also to the west.  To the north, you see what appears to be a solitaire
wizard's dwelling.  It stands apart in this compound as the only private
residence in your sight.  You can not see a visible entrance to the northern
residence, but you sense something there nonetheless.

Corner in the Walls of House {2Baenre{0~
~
The wall comes together here, leaving exits only north and western.  To
the north is a long stretch of empty, or apparently unused at the least,
floor.  To the west is a sole wizard's dwelling.  A scampering lizard looses
a small rock on your head as he scampers quietly by on the ceiling overhead.

The wall stretches southward into a corner, where it continues west, and
north.  Farther to the north the wall also turns westward, but before that
is a large building, built rather large, but low enough that you do not lose
sight of the wall.  No markings adorn this building, and you do not see any
visible movement there now.

travel, however, for the air does not feel friendly in this dark corner, and
you feel the weight of the darkness on your shoulders.

population of House {2Baenre{0 commoners.  The large building has several
rooms, all of prisonlike decor, and an incarcerated atmosphere permeates
your nostrils.  To your north a double doorway opens out to the courtyard.

between a row of bunks in the largest chamber.

These quarters are lush and extravagantly decorated, and upon cursory
inspection, quite feminine.  A brief look is enough to assure you that this
is the female's quarters, and that no males are tolerated here.  While not
feminine in the surface sense of the word, this building is characterized as
such by its delicate appearance.  Light colors and strong construction make
this building almost a study in contrasts.  There is little else here of

presence.  Scorched walls and oderiferous fumes trademark this room, while
scrolls, librams, and tomes of all manner and history litter the area. 
Shelves fill each of the four walls, and piled high in the center of the
room is a desk of sorts.  You see no signs of any sleeping arrangements, nor
any visible exits at first glance, yet you still feel an uneasy presence

the darkness that your light just can't permeate here.  The only way out is
the way you entered to the east, and leaving is a prospect smelling rather

prevent the entire city petitioning against the ruling house.

You stand in the center of a vast compound, inhabited for century upon
century by the ruling house of Menzoberranzan, House {2Baenre{0.  To the
near north is a large gateway leading north into the city itself.  Directly
south is the great Temple of Lloth, which dominates the compound's vast
courtyard.  The temple is shaped like a large hemishperical dome, and a
great pointed stalagmite hangs down pointing from the vast ceiling above,
almost as a reminder that Lloth's favor can be lost upon a whim.  However,
the Temple has stood for thousands of years with this everpresent threat,
and House {2Baenre{0 shows no worry of losing Lloth's favor soon.

temple, which is entirely built around a single slab of stone.  The stone is
a table of sacrifice for Lloth, and even now runs red with centuries of
bloodshed.  At the moment, the temple is empty.  A half drawn summoning
circle lies in the middle of the temple, along with a manual of worship to
Lloth.  The only exit is to the north, and a living statue lies unmoving
along the south wall.

own, but the similarities end there.  To the north is the school of
Arach-Tinilith, the home of drow priestesses who dedicate their lives to the
service of Lloth.  East is Melee-Magthere, where young drow learn the way of
the warrior, and the arts of combat.  Sorcere, perhaps the most mysterious
of these schools lies westward.  This last, the school for drow with magical
aptitude shimmers with a magical aura, and you seem unable to focus your
attention upon it.

To either side of you are large, thick wooden doors.  They are solid, even
though they appear ready to crumble to nothing at any moment.  To the south
lies the exit to the tavern, while the hallway continues to the north.  {0

Pit of bubbleing acid~
~
You are standing on a small island in a lake of bubbleing acid inside
this large pit.  The fumes riseing up off the lake, make you sick to your
stomach, and it is slowly draining you.  Suddenly you are overcome with a
sickening feeling....  As you finish emptying the contents of your stomach
you open your eyes and notice that the acid level is slowly starting to
rise.  It looks like acid that could easily disolve you instantly!  Better
get out fast!
