The altitude you are at is insane.  The globe below you begins to
bend in the distance as the round shape of the planet is becoming very
noticable.  RagNaRok is above, and the air is thinning....

Your feet touch the red ground of RagNaRok.  All around you there is
nothing but a large, rocky desert.  The red sand and dust blow by on the
cold surface.  You notice there is a path leading north on the RoK.
