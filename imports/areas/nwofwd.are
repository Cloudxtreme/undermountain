peaks.  These two mountains shelter the road from the cold breeze that
can be felt up among this mountain range.  The road is constantly in
the shadow of either of the two mountains and this makes it a suitable

the east, large mountains obscure the view of the road.  The High Road
is now right alongside the edge of the cliff to the west.  A careless

of swords.

The bulk of the mountain range rises up to the south.  The High
Road appears to be emerging from those mountains, and along some hills
that stretch out to the north.  There are a few noticeable tracks that
wander along this part of the road, they dont appear to be humanoid in
size but somewhat larger.

has prevented it from carrying on any further to the west.  It is
possible to see a few creatures lurking around under the water in the
sea of swords.  Far off to the south, many mountains are visible
accross the horizon.  Somewhere off in the distance to the northeast,
