This unspeakably huge creatures great teeth drip with eager juices, and
its eyes gleam with a feral, unquenchable hunger.  Savage while slumbering,
this gargantuan is even more vile while awake.  Consuming everything in its
path merely for the sake of an insatiable appetite, it resembles nothing you
have ever seen.  Part dragon perhaps, its rippling fleshy body is covered
with a dark, rusty color.  An odor that defies words surround it, and its
claws are larger by far than the largest sword wielded by any hero.

{*You scale this dangerous stone wall in almost total darkness.  The
handholds are old and loose, and pieces of earth crumble away beneath your
fumbling fingers.  {0 {* Beneath you the ledge drops precariously far, and

small gateway, covered with an ancient iron portculis.  {0
