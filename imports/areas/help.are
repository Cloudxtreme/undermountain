Airship-Battle~
[ How To Battle Other Airships ]
{x
 Any airship can do battle, and any airship can be attacked.  There is no NPK
airships in the air, all are vulnerable.  Of course depending on the pilots
and such, certain rules can and cannot apply.
See RULELIST 4 for all airship rules.
{x
 There are two methods of attacking another ship.  You can either directly aim
the cannon at the airship, or shot at it from a distance.
{x
[ CLOSE RANGE COMBAT ]
 Close range combat is only possible when the airship is in the same
room as your airship.  From the airship's weapon room, type
AIM (Cannon Name) (Airship Name). This will aim your cannon at the other
airship.  Type FIRE (Cannon Name) to fire your cannon.
{x
[ LONG RANGE COMBAT ]
 Long range combat can be used against airships within a 15 rooms radius.
From the airship's weapon room, type AIM (Cannon Name) (Direction).  To
fire, type FIRE (Cannon Name).  This will fire your cannon up to 15 rooms.
Long range battle takes a little longer to caculate hit or miss.
{x
 Once an airship has been disabled, two things will happen, and other
options will become available.
{x
[1] All members of the crew will recieve an Airpoint Token.  These objects
can be eaten to gain an Airpoint.  Airpoints can be used to purchase airship
items and other items from the Airpoint Master, found in Port Torregiano.
{x
[2] All airships have a record of kills and destructions, which can be
displayed by typing TOPPILOT.  To see an airship's record, while on board,
type the command.  Your record will change depending if you were disabled
or destroyed another ship.
{x
[3] The "BOARD" command can be used once an airship is disabled.  This command
allows you to board another dead airship, in which you can PK any PK players,
steal their items, and do anything within the rules to the airship.  To board,
type BOARD (Airship Name).  To go back to your airship, type DEBOARD.
{x
 There is also an airship arena for use, which allows you to battle other
airships without having to repair them afterwards.  There is no challenge
system like the PK arena, all challenges are made by talking to another
airship, and setting up a match.  Type ARENA AIRSHIP CHALLENGE to teleport
your airship to the challenge room.  From there, you can drive down to the
arena and do battle.  When done, your airship will be transfered to rooms
marked "WINNER" or "LOSER".  You can hear airship arena battles by turning
on the airship arena battle channel, by typing ARENA AIRSHIP ON.

Airship-Before~
[ What you need to know before purchasing ]
 If you are thinking about buying an airship, then please please please read
this file, airships are concidered a mud "hobby" or "extra activity".  Airships
are not an easy nor cheap thing to own.
{x
[1] WHAT IS AN AIRSHIP?
 To know the more RP side of an airship, please read HELP AIRSHIP-INTRO.  On
the mud, an airship is basically a movable object linked to an area.  From the
outside an airship looks like any other object in the mud, and can be entered
like a portal.  Unlike portals they need to be unlocked and opened before
entering ito them.  Inside, you find a small area that basically belongs to
you.  You enter into the "Helm" which is 1 of 2 important rooms.  From the
helm you "drive" your airship around, which basically moves the object outside
from room to room.
{x
[2] WHAT IS INVOLVED?
 There is many things, costly things involved with an airship.  Your airship
is made up of several "Systems" which you may need, and may cost platinum.
{x
{x  <A> THE HULL
{x    - Purchased in a "Hull Construction Shop", this is the size and design
{x    of an airship.  A hull is the area layout, how many engines and weapons
{x    the airship can hold, and size.  See HELP AIRSHIP-DESIGN for airship
{x    specifications.
{x
{x  <B> WEAPONS
{x    - Purchased in the "Weapons Construction Shop", this is what protects
{x    your airship from other airships.  There are no NPK airships.  There is
{x    a wide range of weapons, and how much damage they can cause.  For more
{x    information, see HELP AIRSHIP-WEAPON.
{x
{x  <C> ENGINES
{x    - Purchased in the "Engine Construction Shop", this is what makes your
{x    airship fast or slow.  Different engines and different amounts of
{x    engines will make your airship move faster or slower.  For more info
{x    see HELP AIRSHIP-ENGINE.
{x
{x  <C> FUEL & AMMO
{x    - Fuel is purchased at "Fueling Stations" located at ports and various
{x    locations around the world.  Your airship burns 1 gallon of fuel per
{x    engine every 4 real life minutes.  Ammo which is what you shoot out of
{x    your weapons can be found at Ammo Shops, located on ports.
{x
{x  <D> REPAIR
{x    - If your airship is destroyed or damaged by other airships, you may
{x    need to repair your airship.  There is two different types of repair,
{x    which bring different costs.  See HELP AIRSHIP-REPAIR.
{x
{x  <E> HULL MATERIAL
{x    - Airships are also Hull Material, which is what the outside of your
{x    airship is made of.  This is basically what determines how many "Hitpoints"
{x    your airship can have.  Hitpoints like players is used in battle.  Airships
{x    are built with wooden hulls (10,000hp) and can have materia hulls
{x    (40,000hp).  See HELP AIRSHIP-HULL for more information.
{x
{x  <F> PARKING & SAFETY
{x    - Your airship must be parked in a safe zone or "Parking Area", if not,
{x    then your airship is vulnerable to attack.  There are several areas of
{x    parking, from simple parking to renting and private hangars.  See
{x    HELP-AIRSHIP-PARK for more information.
{x
 These are the basics you need to know for airships, most of them cost money,
which airships only support mainly platinum prices.  Airships can also be
customized, their room descriptions, room names, and other smaller additions.
See HELP AIRSHIP-CUSTOM for more information.  If you still wish to purchase
an airship, see HELP AIRSHIP-BUY for detail instructions on purchase.

Airship-Buy~
[ How To Purchase Airship Stuff ]
{x
 Welcome to buying your airship, we hope you have read HELP AIRSHIP-BEFORE,
which explains all about airships, and what it means to purchase one.  This
section will tell you the step by step process of purchasing an airship.
{x
{x  <1> Airships & all other supplies for them can be purchased at Port
Torregiano, in the city/area of Torregiano.  There are several ways to get to
Port Torregiano.
{x  - From Market Square: 24e,24n,1w,1n,4w,1n,1d,1n,1d,1w (To Hull Shop)
{x  - Torregiano Recall: 1e,2s,1w,1n,4w,1n,1d,1n,1d,1w (To Hull Shop)
{x  - Train Station: 1n,1e,1n,1w (To Hull Shop)
 The first step is to purchase your HULL, which is what determines the design
and other specifications.  Type LIST to see a display of purchasable hulls.
When you are ready to purchase, type BUY (#) NAME OF AIRSHIP.  The (#) is the
number displayed from list.  Here are a few pointers on airship names.
{x 1. Airship names can be coloured.
{x 2. Do {Rnot{x use THE in the name, alot of codes already add this.
{x 3. Try and not use characters in the begining of the name like |\/!@#$%^*&()
{x    The reason is, anytime you do something with your ship or someone else,
{x    they will have to put those characters in.
{x
{x  <2> Once you have your hull, next comes engines.  Go 1 west, and you will
find the Engine Shop.  There are two different engines, you can have a min.
of one each, but your ship will be slow as all hell.  Engines do make a
difference in speed.  The more V# it has, the bigger it goes.  Purchase as
many or as few as you wish.  If your airship supports the "Sub-Ether" engine,
you can purchase that too.  That engine allows you airship to teleport to
beacons.  See Help Airship-Teleport.
{x
{x  <3> After engines, your airship is able to fly.  Next comes weapons.  You
do not need to purchase weapons, but your airship will be vulnerable to
attacks.  Go 1 west from the Engine Shop, and you will find the Weapons Shop.
The more MM the weapon has, the more damage it will cause.  For more info,
see HELP AIRSHIP-WEAPON.
{x
{x  <4> Once you have done all that, purchase some Fuel and Ammo and you will
be set to fly.  Fuel can be found at the fuel pumps located in the port.  To
purchase fuel, go to the pumps and type BUY # FUEL.  # is the number of
gallons you want.  Make sure to have your airship key with you, and have your
key for almost any purchase for airship.  Ammo can be found at the ammo shop,
which works as a regular shop.  To load ammo, type PUT CLIP (Name of Cannon).
There is currently no command to see how much ammo you have.

To change a room name, type AIRNAME (Whatever you want).  This will change
the room name of the room you are in.
{x
2. ROOM DESCRIPTIONS
Room descriptions are edited with a special program, the same kind builders
use to build areas.  To enter this program, type AIRDESC.  The following
should appear.
{x
-=======- Entering APPEND Mode -========-
{x    Type .h on a new line for help
{x Terminate with a - or @ on a blank line.
-=======================================-
>
{x
Anything you type while in this mode will become the room description.  There
are several small commands you can use while in this mode.  To see them, while
in this mode, type .h and they will appear as so.
{x
{x.r 'old' 'new'   - replace text (Example: .r 'Oldtext' 'Newtext'
{x.h               - get help (Displays this)
{x.s               - show what has been written so far
{x.f               - Formats your description to look nice (USE THIS WHEN DONE!)
{x.c               - Deletes everything that has been written.

Airship-Deed~
[ Airship Deed ]
{x
 Each airship has what is known as an identification plaque, which is a record
of who owns the airship.  This allows you to get a new key, and to deboard from
other ships onto your own airship.
{x
 Airships can have as many or as few owners as wanted. The OWNER command allows
airship owners to take control of the deed to their airship. While standing in
the airship, OWNER ADD (Name) and OWNER DELETE (Name) will alter the ownership.
OWNER SHOW will display a list of all owners. Please note that if you remove
yourself from ownership, you will not be able to re-add yourself. Also, once
you have added someone as an owner, they can remove you and steal the airship.
Use caution when adding owners.

Cruiser) and The Falcon (War Cruiser).  We also have the Highwind (Highwind)
within the designs.  We also have several custom designs based on other ships.
{x
 An airship is >>NOT<< an airplane, please don't forget this is a mideval mud
with a technology touch.  Airships do not use electricity, since electricity is
an extremly rare thing.  Even the engines are not electrical in a sense.  Most
airships would look something like a pirate ship attached to a large blimp,
with several propeller engines attached to it.  Some models use different
flotations, like magic, and some do not have a blimp or flotation device.
But most of the time you will see a pirate ship with a blimp.
{x
 If you do not care about the roleplaying aspects of an airship, or how they
work RP wise, then you do not need to read this.  As said above, an airship
does not use electricity.  Starting with the helm, most of the gauges and
stearing is steam or cable moved.  Lights are made from Materia Crystals which
can glow.  Engines do not look like car engines, they're about ten times bigger,
and more mideval looking.  They would look more like a steam engine.  They run
off "Makou Oil" which is like gasoline, and move like a normal engine.  The fuel
is ignited by a different type of Materia Crystals (Which are basically placed
in the engine like a spark plug, but do not have any wires off them).
{x
 Most airships also have a "Sub-Ether" engine or "Teleporter" engine, which
allows the airship to teleport to different "beacons".  These engines use a
special gas found in the air to create a bubble around the airship, and jump
into a sub-dimension, the same wizards use to move about with magic.

This is the basic intro, to get more into the RP aspect of the world, please

[ Your Airship Keys ]
{x
 The key to your airship is almost the most important item to your airship.  It allows
you to lock and unlock your airship, start the airship up, and other things.  Anyone
can access your airship with this key, see Rulelist 4 for information.  For more
info, see below's FAQ.
{x
[Q] Where do I get a new key?
[A] Go to Port Torregiano, there is a "Locksmith" shop.  Go to the room, and type
    NEWKEY '(Airship Name)' to recieve a new airship key. Note the ' for multiple-
    word names.
{x
[Q] What happens if my key is stolen?
[A] Its stolen, meaning that person can access your airship anytime they wish.  You
    can avoid this by storing your airship in a PHangar.
{x
[Q] How can I keep my key safe?
[A] Several options.  First you could always sac your key and get a new one
    everytime you want to fly.  Second, you can use the RENT command, which the
    mud takes the key from you, and keeps it safe.  You can get it back by typing
    UNRENT in the same location of your airship.  Third, you can wear the key in
    a special eq slot.

Airship-Ports~
[ Famous Airship Locations & Ports ]
{x
[ Eastern Great Realms ]
- PORT TORREGIANO, located in the City Of Torregiano.
 Port Torregiano is one of the more famous locations for airships, built in the
Tripower's capital city of Torregiano, this is the home of airships.  The
massive port was built in the northwest part of the city, and contains all the
facilities an airship pilot needs.  The port supports construction, repairs,
weapons, ammo, locksmiths, temporary parking and long term parking, private
hangars and much more.  The port is regulated by the Tripower Empire, and owned
by the Judge Corperation.
{x
- Port Vector (Vector) & Airship Park (Westbridge)
 Port Vector is not a public facility, owned, ran and guarded by the Vectorian
Nation, they attempted to make a port the size of the Tripower's, but failed.
The port supports construction, weapons and ammo, but they could not afford
anything else.
{x
 Airship Park is located in Westbridge along the Westbridge River in the
heart of the city.  This is not really a port, but more of a fueling
station and parking zone for city residence.  Phil's Bar is a popular
hang out for pilots fueling their ships.
{x
[ Central Great Realms ]
- PORT HEIFONG III, located in the City of Heifong, Section III.
 Heifong is a massive city located in the center of the continent.  It is home
to five pirate guilds, who took five smaller cities and expanded them during
the Airship Boom.  The guilds split them into five sections.  The Heifong III
Faction rules over the Eastern Port, entrance from airships traveling from the
eastern side of the Great Realms.  Their port is located in the southern end
of the city, and has construction and some facilities.  Airships are allowed
to travel the streets, and the city is equiped for airships.  Heifong is also
home of the black market.
{x
- PORT HEIFONG I, located in the city of Heifong, Section I.
 Located on the western side of the city is Heifong I, the gateway and stopping
area for all airships traveling from the western side of the Great Realms.
Their facilities match Heifong III.  (Nothing else planned at this time).
{x
 To learn more on Heifong, see HELP AIRSHIP-PORTS-HEIFONG.
{x
[ Western Great Realms ]
- PORT FIGARO, located in the city of Figaro.
 Figaro is the largest city in the world, Torregiano coming in second.  The
city is located on the western coast past the worlds largest desert.  The
city is massive, made up of highways setup totally for airship travel.  This
is the home for the Western World's Trade.  Their port boasts everything the
Tripower's port has.

Airship-Ports-Heifong~
[ The History Lesson of Heifong ]
 Heifong is located in the center of the Great Realms, surrounded by impassable
mountains on all sides.  Before the airship boom, only five small cities dotted
the valley, ruled by small factions.  The main support of the valley region was
farming.  When the airships came, the pirates came, and Heifong became the main
stomping ground of the pirates.  After awhile, the pirates guild began to fight
over the area, and the biggest one.  Made up of five different guilds, these
pirates who held no name settled into the valley, and took over the 5 small
cities.  Farming died down, and the black market moved in.  As airships boomed,
the 5 small cities grew until their walls touched each other.  And when that
happened, the city of Heifong was founded, and split into five sections, given
to each guild.
{x                   +---+

{x                   | 4 |
{x                   +---+
 This is how the city is split up into different sections.  The Guilds only go
by the name of their city section.  The 5th Guild, located in the center is the
supreme guild, ruling over the other 4.  The 1st Guild is the gateway and
stopping ground for airships traveling in from the Western Realms.  The 3rd
Guild is the gateway and stopping ground for airships traveling from the
Eastern Realms.  The black market is located in the 5th Section, under the
watchful eye of the 5th Guild.

Airship-Repair~
[ Repairing An Airship ]
{x
 After an airship enters battle, it will almost always need repair, be it
a complete repair from being disabled, or patchwork to fix damage.  Repairing
an airship is basically "healing" the hitpoints.  There are two ways of
repairing an airship.
{x
[ Automatic Expensive Repair ]
 This repair is done automatically, but does cost a good amount of money.
Using the "TOW" command, you tow your airship away to have it repaired.
It is brought back to Port Torregiano, where a crew repairs your airship,
and in the matter of two ticks (4 minutes) your airship will be parked in
the "Airship Repair Pick-Up Lot", located
{x
{x - From Market Square: 24e,24n,1w,1n,4w,1n,1d,1n,1d,1e (To Repair Pick-up Shop)
{x - Torregiano Recall: 1e,2s,1w,1n,4w,1n,1d,1n,1d,1e (To Repair Pick-up Shop)
{x - Train Station: 1n,1e,1n,1e (To Repair Pick-up Shop)
{x
[ Manual Cheaper Airship Repair ]
 There is a cheaper repair option available, which at fully repairing the
airship will only cost 4 platinum for the best hull (automatic costs 100).
This system works by you standing outside your airship with your airship
key, and using the REPAIR command, which will add singular hitpoints
to the airship.  Your airship must be located in the "REPAIR SHOP" located
in Port Torregiano.
{x
{x - From Market Square: 24e,24n,1w,1n,4w,1n,1d,1n,1d,2e (To Repair Shop)
{x - Torregiano Recall: 1e,2s,1w,1n,4w,1n,1d,1n,1d,2e (To Repair Shop)
{x - Train Station: 1n,1e,1n,2e (To Repair Shop)
{x
 To use this option, as explained above, with your airship in the Repair
Shop, and with your character outside the airship and with your airship
key, use the REPAIR command.
{x

Airship-Talk~
[ Communications Between Airships ]
{x
  There are several commands used to talk between airships.
{x
- CB
 The Airship Crystal Broadcaster System is an invention of the Nytek
Corperation, used in the Legion Army and High Tripower Officals.  These
systems have been placed inside all new airships for communication between
other ships.  The crystals are enchanted to allow voices to be teleported
from crystal to crystal, allowing airships to talk to each other from great
distances.  There are two smaller systems built into the crystals.
{x
 Anything you say over the system will be instantly transmitted to the
crystals in each airship, making your words heard to everyone nearby. This
is an excellent way to talk between airships, however keep in mind that
anyone in a ship with a CB system will hear what you are saying.
Syntax: CB (Message)
{x
- Loudspeaker
 All airships are equiped with a loudspeaker system, used to communicate to
airships near by, crew members inside the airship, and onlookers outside the
ship.

 Using your Munchausen Sub-Ether Drive or Teleport Engine is very simple.  If
your airship supports this engine, you can use the "Beacon" system.  Beacons
are a system of floating orbs over the realms, that allow airships to teleport
from one point to a beacon almost instanly.  You can see a list of beacons by
typing "BEACON".  Each beacon has its own number, which is used when using this
engine.  Pick a beacon, and at your helm, type TELEPORT (Beacon Number).  Your
airship will be transported to that beacon.

0 air_tow~
Airship-Tow~
[ Towing Your Airship ]
{x
 Towing comes in handy after airship battles, or if your airship happens to get
stuck somewhere you cannot get it out from.  The command allows you to have your
airship transported to a repair shop or location somewhere in the realms.
{x
 To use the command, with your airship key in your inventory, you type
TOW (Location) and your airship will be transported to that location.
{x
 You can also automatically have your airship repaired by using the TOW AUTOREPAIR
command, which will tow your airship to Torregiano, where it will be repaired to
its full hitpoints.  When completed (Takes about 2 to 4 ticks) the airship will be
dropped off in Port Torregiano Repair Pick-Up Lot.

Airship-World~
[ The Airship World ]
{x
 Airships were the combined creation of the Nytek Corperation and the Makou
Technology Group, two front businesses of the Tripower Empire.  The year was
1253 (Currently 1269 or real life 2002) when airships were introduced to the
world.  Before then, travel across the Great Realms was rough and long, since
most nations stood far apart.  But the airship allowed people to move faster
and make shorter journeys to foreign lands.  The trade businesses soaked this
up, and in 3 short years, almost all major trading businesses owned a fleet.
The Trade World boomed, and the Tripower became the Number 1 traders in the
world, a title that was held by the Vectorian Nation until 1256.
{x
 The world of the air soon formed different groups, which was classified by
the empires in record books.  The massive increase of airship popularity
was known as "The Airship Boom".
{x
TRADERS - Airships and crews who flew cargo around the world to different
couriers and trade posts.  Their airships are slow and bulky, weighted down
by cargo and big to hold more cargo.
{x
PRIVATE - Privatly owned airships usually owned by the rich, until the
Tripower started to produce the single seater airships.  These airships
ranged from medium to large, and were the more faster airships in the sky.
Varies owners from private businesses, clans and empires.
{x
AUTHORITY - The law enforcement of the skies.  Most empires started some
type of law enforcement agency for their skies during the airship boom.
These ships were fast and heavily armed, equiped with air sirens to pull
other ships over for certain law breakage.  Their main goal was to keep
the pirates away from the traders.
{x
PIRATES - Like the earlier "pirates" of the olden day, who sailed the
seas attacking trade ships, a semi-different group of pirates appeared.
Mostly made up of wizards, thieves and mercenaries, the pirates took to
the sky attacking trade ships to steal the cargo, and sell on the black
market.  They formed guilds, who in turn formed smaller groups, and setup
terroritories.  Their ships are fast and armed.  Their natural enemy, the
Authority.
{x
OUTLAWS - An outlaw, who is a person who follows their own laws and rules
also took airships into the skies, mainly to travel between empires.  Their
ships varied in size, speed and weapons, mainly pre-owned airships purchased
cheaper than new.  Most purchased whatever they could find.  An enemy to both
pirates and authority ships.
{x
 These are the five groups classified by the empires of the world, of those
who fly in the air with airships.  To learn more on locations in the world
and some history, please see HELP AIRSHIP-PORTS.

102 build_resets~
Resets~
Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
{x        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
{x        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
{x        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
{x        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset
{x
RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.
{x
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.
{x
If you wish to reset the room then use REDIT RESET.

102 build_sedit~
SEDIT~
{x
Syntax: sedit <social>          -Enters the editor for the selected social.
        sedit add <social>      -Adds a new social
        sedit delete <social>   -Deletes an existing social
        typing SOCIAL brings up a list of all socials on Waterdeep MUD
{x
Usage: 
{x
When in seditor, type # <string> to set the output string for each
action (numbered in sedit 1-8).  Changes made in seditor are immediate.
Typing DONE will exit the editor and save your changes.
{x
NOTES: -Target Not Found (string #8 in seditor) as far as I can tell is
        never called by the MUD and can be ignored.
{x
       -Builders sometimes utilize the social output to trigger mprogs.
        For common socials that have been around a long time, changing
        the output string may cause some of these mprogs to quit
        functioning.
{x
       -Commands of the same name as socials override them when typed.
{x
SEdit appears on Waterdeep courtesy of Meathe from ToD MUD, who took time
out in the spring of 2005 to code it, and credit to Lorna, our resident
liason and friend in the MUD world, for helping to bring it here to us.

Auction~
Unlike some muds, Waterdeep does not have an automated auction
function. The auction channel is available for wheeling and dealing,
but there are no commands related to it - any information given and
all transactions are handled by the players themselves.

{x
{8  Members of the Black Church are followers of Sephiroth. They would lay down
their lives for the Lord and believe themselves to be infused  with Jenova
cells, rendering them special. Their only concern is to serve the "High Priest
of the Apprentice, charged with the task of completing the Apprentice's
resurrection." They are secretive, devout and have definite plans for the lands
beyond the Deva Kingdom.  Nothing matters for these beings beyond the long-term
goal of seeing the Apprentice returned to the lands at the hand of Sephiroth.
However many deaths or disease or famines must occur are merely a means to an
end. They feel no love or compassion for those outside their ranks and their
entire being truly resides around the One True Son - Sephiroth.

{8  Clan Raiding is the act of one clan raiding another clan's hall.  All clans
have an entrance which is connected to 'The Void' and feature similiar defenses
such as clan mazes and guards.  Additional protection can be purchased (TBA).
{8
  All clans have a safe room which raiders are not allowed to enter.  These
rooms are the Healing Chambers which features the clan's Healer and Healing
Pool.  This room is flagged CLAN_ONLY, which means raidings should not be able
via game wise to enter the room.
{8
  All halls have an alert system which will alert the clan of an attempted
raid via "echoes" upon the death of the guards.  Additional alarms will keep
alerting members of raider movement within the halls.
{8
  Clan Flags are looted during a raid and create an imbalancing effect between
the two clans (10% chance of triple hit damage).  For example, if Clan-1 raids
and loots Clan-2's flag, then Clan-1 will have the imbalance effect against
Clan-2 until they loot a flag from Clan-1.  Also each flag that is looted is
counted and can be used towards the purchase of advanced clan hall options.

{8In the wake of the Great Fall of Cruoris, amidst the surge of apostates

loyalty to each other, beholden to no gods, the Hoard lay beyond reach of 
any government. 
{x
Steadily working behind the scenes, we have amassed fortunes of money, 
knowledge, and influence. Uniting scholars and soldiers, merchants, even 
individuals from darker walks of life. The Hoard has expanded its bounds to
envelop many of the facets of daily life in the realms. Dealing in economic
affairs, financially backing politicians, even providing the finest
protection of cargo or escorts. Our presence can be felt in every facet 
of the daily life within the realms, if one is looking in the right
place.
{x
Sometimes our methods may come into question, but it is not control
we seek, merely the profit where control is found lacking. It is not
our place to take a side. Such an action could cost our organization
not just money, but damage that which we value most. The integrity of 
our commitments, regardless of who bid the highest. We are usurers
of the highest quality, an impartial hand guided simply by the flow

{xVector stands as the oldest Empire in the realm. It was recorded as the first 
into the history books of year 500, and reigned supreme over the trade world. 
Ruled by the Emperor's bloodline through the ages, the Vectorian Empire plays 
a major role in history. During the great war of Power, The Empire was under
the reign of Emperor Xavier Vector. The Vectorian Army caused most of the 
destruction in the eastern continent of the Great Realms. Xavier's power grew 
throughout his reign, until the Tripower rised and pushed his entire army back
into the canyons of Heifong, where Xavier alongside his army was lost. An army
feared by the realms vanished within the mountains. Crown prince Ganon Vector, 
son of Xavier rised to the throne upon the disappearance of his father.

The Empire ruled the Trade Routes until Tripower invented the airships. Most of
the remaining funds left in the Vaults were used on reseach and developments for
the ground army and ancient relic's. Ten years after the Tripower tookover the 
trade routes, Emperor Ganon declared a war he can never win. Vector was crushed 
by the new technology of their nemesis, pushed well back beyond their own borders.
Emperor Ganon's advisor Kefka had him assasinated in his sleep, proving the end
of the royal bloodline and took the throne for himself. His first move was to
declare peace. 
{x
Kefka managed to convince the Tripower to assist in rebuilding Vector, which 
they did and lived to regret it. Behind the scenes of Vector's reconstruction, 
Kefka designed a new technology called "Magitek" and is sourced by something
that wasn't meant to be. Espers, the most magical potent race in the realm 
and Kefka discovered a method by draining the Espers into liquid, it can be 
used as fuel for his new machines "The Magitek Armor". It's capable of several
magic attacks including amplified destructive beams, a force that the Tripower
can never ignore. To their suprise, Kefka declared war upon the Tripower, a 
massive war took place and was recorded in the history books as
"The War against The Vectorians". The battle lasted over a year continously, 
on both land and sea, but Vector was defeated by the advancement of the Tripower
technology, airships. Vector's reserved funds were depleted once again, citizens
fled the chaotic lands in search for refuge. Kefka withdraw his army from the
battlefield and the war was declared over. An insane but brilliant man, Kefka
never forgotten about his humiliating defeat. He is mostly withdrawn into his 
personal research and handed his leadership duties to his General and Officials.
{x
After a long discussion the newly appointed individuals Arcartier and Xeptimus 
decided to split Vector into two sectors, Military and Government. Arcartier Zax,
as the General of the Magitek Army continues to strengthen the country's 
borders while further enhancing the Magitek Technology. Xeptimus Xor, as the
Chief Politician of the new age, began studying the Tripower's advancement in
technology in discretion.

{b| {WRestring {8is a command used to change the short description of an   {b|
{b| {8object in your inventory.  Only specific trainers have the ability {b|
{b| {8to restring an object (those in New Thalos) and charge you 50 quest{b|
{b| {8points per item.  Default will return a restrung object back to    {b|

{b| {8Since restringing only changes the short name of the object, the   {b|

{x Faction Name: Apostles of the Crypt
{x Township: Crypts of the Undead
{x Leaders: Scryed, Keegan, Alita, Xaveri
--------------------------------------------------------------------
{x
Originally founded as a subdivision of the Vectorian 
Empire, the Apostles of the Crypt were the clandestine 
assassin squad of Kefka's. Prior to the war with The 
Tripower, Lord Kefka used us to help murder Ganon Vector.
As an undead experiment, the assassin's of the Apostles 
were highly effective during the in-fighting.
{x
Once Kefka were defeated by the might of the Tripower,
the Apostles went into hiding. During the years since
the war, a select few of them rose to the top and built
up secret political and economic connections. Now, the
higher ups of the Apostles are hidden within several
governments and businesses posing as the figure heads
for noble families, all the while manipulating behind
the scenes. We manipulate the petty lives of the living
in order to attain our goals.
{x
Just because we prefer to use means other than brute 
force, do not believe that we are weak. Immortal
lifespans have given us many deadly skills that we
employ when necessary. Being an Apostle of the Crypt
requires secrecy, skill, and intelligence. If you wish 
join the elite ranks of the undead, leave a note we will
decide whether to contact you.

 Faction Name: Church of Istishia
 Township: New Thalos
 Leaders: Naithe, Ryan, Istishia
--------------------------------------------------------------------
{x
Istishia, Elemental Lord of Water, has a varied and scattered following
around the Realms. Folk of all walk of life come together to revere the
God-King of the Undines and further His goals. Because of their
diversity, Istishians are most often found in a number of cults, though
time has seen the occasional rise and fall of a unified church. They can
be identified by their devotion to their God and by their symbol, a
cresting wave.
{x
Lately, the balance has been shattered. The influence of Kossuth, the
Fire Lord, had shifted the natural balance of power and skewed the way
of the Realms. His following, known as the Flame, has grown strong and
altered the very nature of things. Their work, while good in intention,
causes disruption and must be stopped before things spiral out of
control. Heeding the call of their God, the members of the Church of
Istishia pool their strength to wear down the Flame and return things
to the way they should be. Like the tide ebbs and flows, so shall
balance be returned so that the Realms may live peacefully once again.
{x
[OOC]
{x
All that is required the join CoI is an interest in roleplay. All
levels, tiers, and clans will be considered, though please keep in
mind that this is a church and, as such, your character should worship
Istishia in some way or have strong ties to the element of Water. To
apply, please submit a roleplay application (note to churchistishia)
or speak with one of the leaders.

See HELP GD-Istishia for more information about our God.

 Faction Name: Emirc Dezinagro Syndicate
 Townships: The Underdark, Darrowmere, and Meznoberranzan
 Leaders: Alsin, Vandalandius, McDougal, Throm
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Syndicate is a group of individuals whose goals are self
preservation and the enrichment of its members by any means
necessary. It is a self sustaining organization that renounces all
forms of government and relies solely on the bond of its citizens to
provide a safe haven for people of all takes who share the same
common goals. The diversity of people within the Syndicate is easily
noted, even in its leadership. Everyone from renowned Crimelords to
distinguished Merchants have found their place as part of the
Syndicate, and call the lands of the Syndicate home.
 
In order to ensure each citizen can attain the common goals of the
Syndicate its leaders perform the following tasks:
 
1. Ensure all lands in which the Syndicate reside remain free of any
   rule and that those lands serve their purpose in acting as safe
   havens from any form of government.
 
2. Ensure all citizens have a means of attaining the common goals by
   granting support in the effects of financial, mercantile, arcane,
   brute force, and safety. 
 
3. Ensure any and all threats to the Syndicate as a whole or to any
   single citizen are dealt with accordingly and in a timely manner.
 
In return, the citizens of the Syndicate agree to unite in times of
need and when called upon by the Leaders to fend off threats to any
citizen or to the lands in which the Syndicate resides. This unity
has allowed Renowned crimebosses, The Rejected of Society, and
anarchists to find a safe haven from the law of former lands in
which they resided. On top of that, its a feasible way to filter
themselves into society as Merchants or traders, if they wish,
without being questioned. Merchants, politicians, and Nobles of the
realm are attracted to the Syndicate because their trade deals,
supplies, and trade routes are guaranteed to be safe along with the
fact that there is no taxation, government restrictions, or
regulations imposed on them. 
 
*OOC* : To join the Syndicate post a roleplay or forum to the
Syndicate requesting to join. We primarily look for true neutral
- chaotic evil aligned people who meet the following criteria:
 
1. Have the RP flag on and willing to RP
2. PK is preferred, but NPK is accepted
3. Active and willing to have your name used in RP
4. Be in good standing with the leaders and other Synners.
 
For any other questions about the Syndicate, its RP, or other
requiments to join feel free send a tell or note to the Leaders
and/or Architects of the faction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
FLAME is an RP Faction/Cult.  Devoted to the God of Fire, Kossuth. 
We are his mortal agents within the realms.  With the rise of the
Church of Istishia the influence of Kossuth was threatened, as was the
intention of the members of the Church of Istishia.  From this threat
FLAME was born.  Atandella and Elbryan stepped up and gathered all of
those that would follow them in the fight against the water loving
church.  With Istishia under control, Flame broadened itself by
setting out to help the people of Polaris.  Our mission is to relieve
them of the constant chill they are forced to live with everyday. 
Should you be interested in joining us in our fight just send a note
to the leaders.  You may also talk to any of the current members of
the collective, they will be more than willing to help you get the
information you need.

Jihad~
------------------W-A-T-E-R-D-E-E-P--F-A-C-T-I-O-N------------------
Faction Name: Jihad
Township: Jenova
Leaders: Grobnak, Kiora, Namira, Thims, Nerlith, Wildren
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Alignment: Lawful Evil
 
Ao, in an attempt to fully destroy The Apprentice, has sent the RoK before.
Each time it is sent, it is beaten back... and sent again generations later.
It is for this reason that Jihad believes Ao to be evil, and needs to be
destroyed.  The Jenovese (Jihad) believe that by destroying the RoK in its
current incarnation, it is only leaving the problem to future generations.
Jihad seeks a long-term solution.
 
In the Time Before Time, Ao took on a pupil- The Apprentice.  Ao gave unto
his Apprentice a world to build life- and build life he did.  When the time
came to inspect his pupil's work, Ao discovered his Apprentice had created
a world far superior to his own.  In jealousy, Ao sought to destroy this new
world.  The Apprentice opposed him, and was murdered alongside his creations.
The Great Realms would not see life again until the mortals Nisstyre and
Teron stumbled upon it millennia later.
 
In his final moments, The Apprentice prophesied his own return- That when
next Ao destroyed the Great Realms, he would be resurrected to reclaim
his throne, as well as Ao's for his treachery.  In making this Prophecy,
The Apprentice vested his final lifeforce into the RoK- making of it a
dead god.  By worshipping the RoK, many Jenovese hope to sustain and
strengthen that ailing force.  They also believe that by doing so, they
leave an imprint of their soul upon The Apprentice's memory- and will
be Reborn after the RoK strikes and Ao has been defeated.
 
It should be noted that not all of the Jenovese worship the RoK, or
seek its fall.  The common citizens of Jenova often play no role in
their government's schemes.  Also, Jihad's five Divisions vary slightly
in their beliefs.  Lastly, there is the fanatical group which calls itself
Dissonance- this group of Cyricists believe The Prophecy is a prophecy of
Cyric ascending to Elder Godhood- *as* The Apprentice.
 
The five Divisions of Jihad are:
(HoF) Harbingers of Faith
(WoR) Warriors of Ragnarok
(JNP) Jihad Naval Patrol
(JRO) Jenovese Reconnaissance Order
(JRS) Jihad Research Syndicate

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pax Faerunis
(means, 'The Peace of Faerun')
Alignment: Neutral Good
{x
Our purpose is to bring peace and freedom to whatever lands we control.
Assorted members of four clans have come together to use their unique
talents to combat whatever force threatens peaceful people.
{x
The Church of Mysteries worship Mystra, Goddess of Magic - seeking out
new and old magic alike, protecting and preserving it.
{x
The Church of Celestia are peace-loving worshippers if Celestia, looking out
into the Heavens for inspiration.
{x
The Church of Justice - worshippers of Tyr, The Even Handed - metes out
impartial justice.
{x
And finally, The Harpers, have always moved behind the scenes, to maintain
the balance of power in the Realms.
{x
Now, with The Rok - that Bringer of Death to All - coming ever closer,
members of these organizations have made their longstanding alliance
into a political entity - no longer neutral, not longer pacifist.
{x
The Mystrans have opened their secret libraries and magical storehouses
to their allies by preparing 'The Archive' - the largest collection of
magical knowledge the Realms have seen.
{x
The Celestians, once content to gaze at the stars, have now turned their
eyes to The Rok, flaming over the Realms - promising destruction. With
the help of the other allies, they are contructing 'The Celestial Focus'
- a new telescope that will peer into the heart of The Rok itself.
{x
The Tyrrans have contributed their administrative, and governing skills,
to help the Mystrans and Celestians raise the funds necessary to complete
their tasks. Their honor, and fairness (it is hoped) will keep their city
politically stable, and keep hope alive that a solution will be found.
All citizens can look upon their 'Temple of The High Court' and know
that they are ruled justly.
{x
And finally, The Harpers have sent their agents out into the Realms,
infiltrating the other governments and factions of the land
- watching, waiting - sending much needed information back to their
home city.
{x
Are you willing to become a member of a city, a nation - that will
fight The Rok with all its resources?
No one is too small, no one is too inexperienced. Join us in our fight.
{x
How to Join? - Contact any of the Leaders of the Faction for information.

Vector is known to be one of the oldest Empires in the world.  It
was the first to be recorded into the history books of year 500, and
reigned supreme over the trade world until the Tripower.  Ruled by
bloodline Emperors, the Vectorian Empire has played many parts in
the role of history.  Duringthe Great Power War of the 700 years,
Vector joined the armies of Cyric and Talos, under the rule of
Emperor Xavier Vector.  The Vectorian Army was the cause of most
destruction in the eastern Great Realms, including the destruction
of Thalos.  Xavier's powers grew as the army marched, a magical ring
his source.  His army reigned supreme until it was pushed back into
the canyon maze area east of Heifong, in which Xavier lost his ring,
his powers, and most of his army.  The group disappeared into the
mountains.  Xavier's son who was still in Vector took the throne.
{x
Vector was ruler of the Trade Routes until the invention of the
airship by the Tripower. By the time of the airship Vector was
already in bad shape.  Its current leader, Emperor Ganon Vector
had spent much of the empire funds in research in technology, and
lost projects.  After loosing its trade to Tripower, roughly ten
years after, Ganon declared war on the Tripower.  After rebuilding
its citizens and army, Vector took over the local trade routes on 
land and sea.  The Tripower attacked back, crushing Vector on the 
routes, and pushing its armies well back beyond their own borders.
Then suddenly the war ended, as Ganon's advisor Kefka, had him
assasinated.  Kefka took up rulership over Vector, since there
wasn't anymore Vectorian Family Blood left, and declared peace.
{x
Kefka convinced the Tripower to help rebuild the empire, in which
they did, only to their deepest regret.  Behind the scene of the 
Vectorian Reconstruction, Kefka was designing a new technology of
his own.  It would be dubbed "Magitek" Technology, and its source 
of power something that wasn't meant to be.  The Esper Race was 
one of the most magical potient races known in the world.  Kefka 
discovered somehow, by cringing an esper up into a liquid, the 
liquid itself could be used in machinery.  Kefka made a machine, 
known as The Magitek Armor.  This large beast device, ran off the
magical liquid.  It was capable of several magical attacks, and 
was a force to be reconned with.  Kefka declared war on the 
Tripower, to there suprises.  A massive war broke out, dubbed 
"The War Against The Vectorians".  Kefka gave a good battle, but 
after a year of battling on both land, air and sea, the rebuilt 
funds of Vector once again became empty, and the citizens fled 
the chaotic lands of Vector.   In a final attempt Kefka marched 
the remains of the Magitek Army into Westbridge, only to have its
local citizens and protectors kill the army.  From this point, the 
war was declared over, Vector and Kefka receeded behind their 
borders, into a unknown silence.

[ What Is A Faction? ]
{x
 Factions is a named used for small governments that excist in the world.
In the RP world of the Great Realms, there are three sizes of governments.
Factions, who rule over one or two towns and land.  Nations who rule over
towns and cities, twice the land size of factions.  And Empires, which is
the largest of all governments.
{x
 Factions in the mud sense is like a clan, except the purpose of a faction
is to run their towns and attrach players to "live" within their cities.
A faction can be made up of any type of player, 1st/2nd tier, NPK/PK, etc.
Anyone can join a faction with the help of a faction leader or faction
member.
{x
 The main purpose of factions is fun and entertainment.  An extra game to
play besides leveling and collecting EQ.  The most fun of the system will
come from the "Faction War" system, still in development.  Factions own
actual areas out of the mud.  They can trade these areas between other
factions for platinum.  But Factions can also declare war on each other,
which in the end of war, the winning Faction collects areas known as
"War Zones" that Faction Leaders appoint during war.
{x
 And that is the Faction System of today, so far.

{x
Queen Of The Air, Lady Of Air, Lady Of The Winds
{x
Akadi is the goddess of elemental air, speed, and flying creatures.  Like
her fellow elemental deities, she is an alien and aloof deity. As a deity
of freedom and travel, she teaches that her followers should move as much
as possible from place to place and from activity to activity. She and her
worshipers are diametrically opposed to Grumbar and his followers. The
domains associated with her are Air, Illusion, Travel, and Trickery, and
her favored weapon is the heavy flail.
{x
Akadi's religious following in the Great Realms has never been firmly
established.  As her nature is passive and introverted, many speculate if
her domain even spans as far as these isolated realms.

GD-Azuth~
Help Azuth:
 
Azuth is the god of wizards and mages and to a much lesser degree, 
all spellcasters, as opposed to Mystra, who is goddess of all magic.
Azuth is Mystra's servant, friend, and advisor.
 
In religious art, Azuth is most often portrayed as a bearded old man 
unbent by age, wielding a stout, gem-topped staff.
 
Azuth is a sober sort of father-figure deity, but he is not humorless or
mean-spirited. He has a rather dry, sardonic wit and appreciates plays on
words and stuble humor. He has perfected a straight-faced delivery to such
a degree that often those who hear him speak are left wondering whether 
some of his comments were said seriously or in jest. When he is in good
humor, he likes to present those who have called on him with small gifts,
such as flowers in unusual colors, magical fabric or elegant drape, or 
edible delicacies. When he is upset, his wrath is terrible to behold as the
air crackles with magical energy about him that seems to flow both into and
out of his eyes and the "Old Staff", a divine artifact of ancient construction
that he wields to devastating effect.

GD-Bane~
{CBane {w({cBAIN{w)
{x
The Black Lord, The Black Hand, the Lord of Darkness
{x
Bane, the Lord of Darkness, has conquered death itself, returning to the
world to give dark inspiration to a thousand intrigues, to foment fear
and hatred in civilized lands, and to reassure the common mortal that
tyranny, through it may suffer occasional defeat, will never die. Though
Bane transcended mortality centuries ago, his primary goal remains
notably human -- he seeks nothing short of the total domination of
Faerun. When his servants sit upon the throne of every land, when
commoners serve their masters in fear for their very lives, and when
altruism and hope have been erased from the world, only then will Bane
rest. Until that dark day, however, the Black Hand has eternity to hatch
demented plots and vile intrigues.
{x
Bane has a small, but loyal following in the Great Realms, spurred by his
appearance some years ago.  Followers of Bane hold very few formal
religious rituals; prayers for spells at midnight and perhaps on the eve
of a major battle.  Worshipers revel in offering sacrifices to the Black
Lord, often of intelligent or innocent beings, usually upon an altar of
black basalt or obsidian.  They open worship Bane, and use fear and
coercion to demand respect. The recent disappearance of this diety from
the Great Realms has not had much of an impact on his religion thus far.

{x
Lord of Murder, God of Death, The Nameless One, The Great Demon
{x
Bhaal is the Lord of Murder, the god of violence and premature death in all
forms.  His name is never spoken out of fear, rather when spoken of, he is
referred to his other names, such as the Nameless One or the Great Demon.
He is a god who witnessed his own death, and who takes special delight in
watching the untimely demise of the most innocent of creatures:  children,
women, and holy figures of any and all religions.  Such are often the target
of sacrifice for Bhaal's worshipers.
{x
Bhaal's followers, unknown in number, worship him in secrecy, and are
responsible for transporting souls from this world to the next. The powers
they gain through worship are rarely passed on to new disciples, but rather
hoarded and reveled in, and taken with them to the afterlife.  Thus, Bhaal's
religion has been slow to gain momentum in the few places it has appeared.
The fact that these worshipers gain power through his worship suggests that
Bhaal is still alive, despite rumors to the contrary.  Evidence of dark
rituals to the Nameless One has been seen throughout the Great Realms,
though it is unclear whether or not Bhaal's himself holds influence in our
realm.

The Grain Goddess, The Great Mother, Earthmother
{x
Chauntea is the goddess of agriculture, plants cultivated by mortals, farmers,
gardeners, and summer.  She makes her home in the plane of Elysium and attracts
followers who are of a neutral or good moral alignment. Those who worship
Chauntea believe that the Earthmother is the life giver of the natural world-
the manifestation of the earth itself. Indeed, Chauntea is one of the oldest of
the elder deities, born during the creation of Toril. In the Moonshae Isles, she
is worshipped by her ancient name of Jannath, though few recognize this name in
the Greater Realms.
{x
Chauntea is represented by two symbols: the budding flower encircled with a
sunburst, and a sheaf of golden wheat upon a green field. The latter symbol is
not as popular as the older, former though both are well recognized. Chauntea
is portrayed as a mother figure, an affectionate woman of middle years, wise by
virtue of a long life lived well. She is on good terms with the other natural
deities, such as Silvanus, Mielikki and Eldath, and counts Talona, Auril and
Talos as her foes.

0 god_cyric~
GD-Cyric Cyric~
Born in the slums of Zhentil Keep, Cyric (seer-ick) is the son of a
Zhentarim officer and the young woman who adored him. The officer
openly denied the woman's charge of paternity and cast her into the
streets. The homeless of Zhentil Keep cared for the woman, and
helped her through delivery. After learning of his son's birth, the
officer killed the young woman and sold Cyric into slavery.
{x
A short time later, Cyric was purchased by a rich Sembian family,
who raised him as their own in a life of luxury. A highly intelligent
child, Cyric always felt that he was different from the other
children he grew up with. His suspicions were confirmed at age 10,
while overhearing his parents arguing over him. Cyric immediately
ran away from home, but was stopped and returned by a civil patrol.
Cyric's complaints at the patrol's actions caused his true origins
to spread throughout the city, forcing his parents to become social
outcasts. When he again left home at age 12, no one stopped him.
{x
Alone in an unfamiliar world, Cyric learned survival skills in the
wild before moving on to life on city streets. Becoming adept at
thievery, Cyric drew the attention of the Thieves' Guild. Earning
their approval and support, Cyric remained with the guild for four
years. At 16, Cyric left to spend the next eight years pursuing his
love of travel, and learning that people were the same no matter
where he went. At the end of his travels, Cyric secretly returned to
Zhentil Keep to further explore his origins. He may have met his
father there, but the man was killed before Cyric could question him.
{x
Convinced that a life of thievery was wrong, Cyric became a fighter
of little consequence. However, during a quest in the Jungles of
Chult, he crossed paths with one Kelemvor Lyonsbane. It was Kelemvor
who convinced Cyric to join the guard of Arabel, where he met Adon,
cleric of Sune Firehair. Together, the three worked for Myrmeen Lhal,
protecting her lands, until confronted by Midnight. Thus began
Cyric's path to greatness. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyric continued to follow the path of goodness until Lady Mystra's
rescue. Mystra offered the group anything they wished in appreciation
for her freedom. Kelemvor asked only for fresh horses and rations.
Mystra found it strange that they did not request god-hood. Upon
hearing this, Cyric began to think.
{x
Following the battle against Lord Bane's forces at Shadowdale, Cyric
left the party and struck out on his own, leading a small group of
Zhent warriors on his yet unseen quest to become a god. During his
travels, Cyric came into the possession of a rose-hued, vampiric sword,
which came to play a significant role in Cyric's career. Crossing
paths with his former companions several times, Cyric was responsible
for the death of Bhaal, Lord of Murder. Having tasted the blood of a
god, Cyric's new weapon hungered for more, thus increasing Cyric's
desire to destroy his one-time friends.
{x
Concluding the Avatar crisis, Cyric faced his final confrontation as
a mortal atop Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep. There, he not only
destroyed his second God, Lord Myrkul, he also found his revenge
against the hated Kelemvor Lyonsbane. (It has been pointed out that
Midnight actually killed Myrkul; a fact which Cyric denies.) The
sword drank eagerly of its victim's blood, and Kelemvor was no more,
for now... With the original quest of recovering the Tablets of Fate,
Overlord Ao, creator of the Realms and of the gods themselves,
descended upon Toril and spoke to its inhabitants. Lord Ao declared
that all gods become servants to their followers, that Midnight take
Mystra's place as Goddess of Magic, and that Cyric shall take control
of what was left undone by the deaths of Myrkul, Bane, and Bhaal. And,
while Cyric found this responsibility quite an honor, Lord Ao was
unsure he'd continue with that reasoning.
{x
(continued in "help cyric2")

Some time later, Lord Ao returned to resurrect the Lord of Murder in
the Moonshae Isles. Bhaal's second coming was short-lived, and Cyric
became the official caretaker of the Church of Assassins. Meanwhile,
Cyric joined forces with Mask (Lord of Shadows) to murder Leira, Lady
of the Mists, giving Cyric the powers of Deception and Illusion.
{x
Ten years passed since the Time of Troubles, and Cyric grew restless.
His latest scheme involved a tome he called The Cyrinishad. Three
hundred and ninety-seven versions were created until Cyric was
satisfied. The tome, dubbed "The Book of Lies" by other gods of the
pantheon, outlined the "true" history (in Cyric's mind) of the "One
True God." But Cyric did not stop there. The Cyrinishad was a magical
creation, with the intention that anyone reading the tome would
believe, without question, that all other gods were false; even the
gods themselves...
{x
Many gods could not abide by these actions. Midnight, with the help
of Oghma (The Binder) and Mask, The Cyrinishad's final version was
placed in protective custody, but not before it had been read by
Mask. Cyric had gained yet another follower.
{x
In his final battle as Lord of the Dead, with Bone Castle crumbling
about him, Cyric's rose-hued sword (now dubbed Godsbane) revealed
that there was a traitor in his castle. Realizing that it was, in
fact, the sword who had betrayed him, Cyric took the sword above his
head and snapped it in two. Chaos ensued, and the soul of Kelemvor
Lyonsbane, trapped those ten years within the accursed sword, escaped
to exact revenge against his one-time ally. Another form also emerged
from the sword: The spirit of the sword itself - Mask, Lord of
Shadows. Begging for forgiveness as Cyric attempted to salvage what
he could of the situation, Mask followed his new master out of the
castle. The City of Strife was no more.
{x
As the aftermath was sorted out, the tormented souls of Cyric's
former kingdom looked to Kelemvor for new guidance. Lord Lyonsbane
looked out across his new lands, and declared a new era of Law and
Justice in the Land of the Dead. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the following years, Cyric became despondent, neglecting his godly
duties. Sadly, he was also driven mad by the powers of his own
Cyrinishad, completely believing everything contained within, unable
to distinguish lies from truth. Several of the gods, led by Tyr,
placed Cyric on trial, charged with Innocence by reason of Insanity.
Around the same time, Cyric's precious chronicle The Cyrinishad was
stolen. Upon hearing this, one of Cyric's most devout followers, one
Malik el Sami yn Nasser sought out the tome, in order to return it to
his god. For this service, Cyric bestowed upon Malik the status of
"Seraph of Lies."
{x
In a cruel twist of fate, Malik became the target of a truth spell
cast by the goddess Mystra. As such, Malik is completely unable to
tell a lie. Using this curse as a tool, Mystra called upon Malik to
read The True Life of Cyric as written by several good gods and set to
paper by Oghma. Naturally, Malik had no desire to do such a thing, so
decided to tell the tale of Cyric as all worshippers had heard it
since childhood. Unfortunately, this also counted as lies, and Malik
was forced to read the book as printed. Cover to cover. Upon
completing the text, Cyric became calm, and his sanity was once again
restored. This, however, does not make him easier to deal with.
{x
Malik el Sami yn Nasser, Seraph of Lies, continues to travel the
world, spreading the influence of Cyric, within the confines of his
curse.

"In a hope-forsaken tunnel at the heart of Pandemonium, Cyric awoke...
There was a new kingdom to build. After all, Cyric was still a deity
-- God of Strife and Intrigue, Patron of Murder. As such, he deserved
a palace of suitable size to accomodate his horde of worhipers, a
mammoth treasure house to store the spoils of his victorious war
against Mystra and the Circle of Greater Powers... As always, the
pantheon had been puppets, playing the parts Cyric created for them.
{x
For an instant, the Prince of Lies heard the babel of voices in his
head chime harmonious agreement. None of them could deny his
absolute supremacy over all the gods in Faern. The Cyrinishad proved
the truth of that, and Cyric himself had read the tome very carefully.
{x
All across the mortal realms, a disembodied smile appeared in the most
squalid alleys and haunted, shadow-draped woods. Broad and sharp,
glinting like a straight razor in the moonlight, it hinted at the mad
god's pleasure with a world well-suited to become his earthly kingdom.
The true meaning of the apparitions eluded even the most gifted
oracles. They wove dire but vague prophecies around the chilling
visions, but, as was their wont, the men and women of Faerun heeded
them little and went on with their chaotic, mundane lives.
{x
In the hope-forsaken tunnel at the heart of Pandemonium, Cyric began
to laugh. The world was doomed, but it kept running anyway.

Lord Of All Glyphs And Images, Scribe Of Oghma
{x
Deneir is the god of glyphs, images, and scribes.  He is dedicated to the
accurate rendering of both writing and images, and encourages the spread
of literacy, cartography, and art. He instructs his followers to discover
and record ancient and long-lost writings and to act as scribes and
teachers for the illiterate. His followers include many who are interested
in recording knowledge and discovering new things, especially sages. The
domains associated with him are Good, Knowledge, Protection, and Rune, and
his favored weapon is the dagger.
{x
Many of his followers are concentrated in the vicinity of Baldur's Gate and
Candlekeep, though in latter times, many have taken up the mantle of
travelers and have strived to spread his religion to the north and across
the sea to the Great Realms.

The Gleam in the Eye, the Errant Explorer
{x
Dugmaren Brightmantle is the dwarven god of scholarship, invention, and
discovery.  He is something of an anomaly among dwarven deities, eschewing
the traditional ways of his race and pantheon and instead seeking out new
ideas and new ways of doing things. As a result, those dwarves who have
adopted classes and professions that most dwarves would consider
nontraditional revere him. He teaches his followers to travel widely,
learn as much as possible, and tinker with new mechanisms and ways of
doing things. The domains associated with him are Chaos, Craft, Dwarf,
Good, Knowledge, and Rune, and his favored weapon is the shortsword.
{x
Brightmantle represents the progressive elements of a naturally
conservative race that nonetheless prides itself on its infrequent
innovations. With the recent technological revolution abound in the
Great Realms, Dugmaren has seen an almost explosive growth in his faithful,
inclusive of races other than dwarf.  His recent appearance in these
realms has also helped assert his following, encouraging new innovations
and aiding in the integration of dwarven ideaology in the popular culture.

Ehlonna of the Forests
{x
Ehlonna is an elven deity, though openly worshipped by all people who dwell,
love or make their livelihood in forests and woodlands, which fall under her
watchful protection.  She often appears to others as either a raven-haired
human woman or a golden-haired elven maiden. Her elven name is Ehlenestra. Her
garb varies from serviceable clothing of a forrester or ranger, to the delicate
gown of an elven princess, but always pale green.
{x
Ehlonna is represented by a rampant unicorn symbol and her favored weapons are
the longbow and the longsword.  Her followers believe that animals and plants of
the forest are gifts not to be stolen, opposing those who hunt or rape the land
for personal gain. Ehlonna is aligned with most of the good-aligned deities, and
likewise opposes evil-aligned gods and goddesses.

Goddess of Singing Waters, Mother Guardian of Groves, The Green Goddess
{x
Eldath is the guardian of druid groves, and her presence is felt every place
where there is calm. Her druids and clergy often aid other druidic faiths in
establishing a grove and sanctifying it. In religious art, Eldath is often
depicted as a dark-haired woman dressed in shimmering green or as a dryad or
wild elf with blue and green hair. Her singing is heard in every babbling brook
and waterfall.
{x
Eldath is a pacifist and usually takes no hostile actions even when threatened.
This is one of the reasons Eldath is almost a forgotten power, most of the realms
think of Mielikki, Silvanus, or Chauntea in relation to nature before they think
of her. Eldath is enigmatic and speaks seldom. She seems shy, but possessed of
unknown depths of character and an unexpressed resolve that cannot be broken.
When challenged, she gives before challengers who only later discover that her
appearent acceptence and retreat merely drew them out into an untenable position
where they are surrounded, out of their element, and their reinforcements have
been converted to her side.

GD-Epsilon~
Help Epsilon:
 
 
"The Free Spirit" or "The Wanderer"
 
Epsilon (ep-suh-lahn) is the deity of wanderers and outcasts,
those who are unable to find another place in life.  A kind sort, he
nevertheless acts quite gruff out of habit, and can put off those who
are not prepared.  He has quite a dry wit, but on rare occasions,
permits his more actively mischevious and humorous side to show.
 
He carries a weapon which he named "The Blue Moon", a weapon he
forged while in the east.  It is known as a tachi, which is an
eastern ceremonial sword, used mostly for decoration.  Being
the powerful spellcaster that he was, he enchanted it heavily,
and while it has no special powers to speak of, it is infinitely
sharp, and can slice through even stone as if it were soft butter.
 
His following, as he has no church to speak of, tends to consist of
outcasts, wanderers, and those which wish to emulate either his
skill with the sword, his skill with the Weave, or both.  The
teachings of his following focus on the two aspects of his skill,
both magical and mundane, and all knowledge is passed on by
word of mouth.  The most skilled (note, this is not equivalent
to most powerful) swordsman in his church is known as "The
Master," while the most skilled spellcaster in his church is
known as "The Father."  The final category of member in his
church is headed by the most skilled storyteller, who is referred
to as "The Dreamweaver."  The Dreamweaver is in nominal control
of those who do not fall under the other two categories. All
members of his following are expected to teach those with less
skill than themselves when asked, and are also expected to
seek betterment of themselves in whatever path they choose to
follow.  Members of each sect meet in competition once per
blue moon, on the moon itself, to find who is the most skilled
in each category, all under the supervision and judgement
of Epsilon himself.  These competitions include battles of style
with the sword and magic, and also a competition of stories.
Also included within the festivities are philosophical diatribes
of all sorts, and friendly chats with the god himself, who tends
to enjoy directly associating with mortals still.  Epsilon has
a love of debate and intellectual pursuit of any sort, and will
often reward members of his following who are able to engage
his mind with small tokens of appreciation, such as ornately
engraved tachis and beautifully-crafted armor, both in blue
steel, his most loved metal with which to work.
 
Most followers of Epsilon fit either into the Gladiator/Warrior,
Wizard/Mage, Priest/Cleric, or Strider/Ranger categories,
although nobody is turned away, due to alignment or otherwise.

Help Erevan:
 
Erevan Ilesere (AIR-eh-van ILL-eh-seer)
 
The Trickster, The Chameleon, The Green Changeling, The Ever-Shifting
Shapechanger, The Fey Jester, the Jack of the Seelie Court.
 
As the Elven god of Mischief, Change, and Rogues
 Erevan is the Seldarine's
rebel. While this does not mean he is against the Seldarine
 far from it.
He is devoutly loyal to the cause of the elven deities but also embraces
some of the traits less common to elves
 change, knavery, mischief, thievery
and those who seek excitement beyond their normal restraints. His followers
include various races including elves, half- elves, and many of the sylvan
races
 although any race may worship The Trickster. Appearing usually as a
dashingly handsome male elf, he is one of the most fickle of the Elven Deities
often changing his appearance at will. He is one of the most fun-loving and
unpredictable powers in the  multiverse and he seems incapable of remaining
still or concentrating on a single task for any extended  period of time.
The Trickster enjoys causing trouble for its own sake, but his pranks are 
rarely either helpful or deadly. However, Erevan becomes very dangerous if
sylvan races or weak elven groups are threatened, and he is always
championing the underdog.

forming, and recreating the medium, a radical departure from his old determinbly
fixed nature.

Lady Goldenheart.
 
Hanali is the Elven goddess of love, romance, beauty, fine arts, and 
artists. Lady Goldenheart embodies the passion and zest for life and living 
it to its fullest among the Seldarine. Her followers are dominated by Moon 
and High elves, artists (particularly sculptors), lovers, preformers (bards 
and dancers), and nobles. Hanali has been romantically involved with almost 
every member of the Seldarine and despite differences still remains amicable 
with nearly all her current and former suitors thus showing her nature to 
love, and not hate. Hanali manifests as an elven woman of undescribable 
beauty, hair and eye-colour everchanging, often lightly clothed if at all, 
and when so, wearing fineries that accent, and enhance but never surpass her 
features. She is a being of timeless beauty and benign nature, who always 
forgives minor transgressions and delights in rewarding her followers with 
the bliss of unexpected love and affection. Although she rarely appears, she 
enjoys seeing the growth of love among elves, and her avatar often acts in 
secret to protect young lovers.

Help Helm:
 
The god of guardians and protectors, Helm is the epitome of the guardian, the 
watcher, the guard, and has in years past been greatly venerated by those who 
need to remain watchful for evil at their doorsteps. Helm is ever-vigilant, and 
embodies the spirit of lawful neutrality.
 
Helm makes his home on the clockwork plane of Nirvana, in a region separate from 
Mystra. Helm's Symbol is an open eye painted onto a gauntlet. Helm was once a 
much more powerful god, but has fallen upon hard times. During the Time of 
Troubles, Helm was left with his powers when the other gods were stripped of 
theirs and confined to the Realms and ordered to hold the gates to the outer 
planes against them. He did so all to successfully, and much of the resulting 
destruction of the captive gods is laid at his feet.
 
While still an intermediate power as he was before the coming of the Avatars, his 
star is fading at a time when Torm and Gond are attracting new followers. Helm 
teaches that one must be ever vigilant, ever aware, ever prepared for one's enemies.
He also serves who stands and waits and watches carefully. Careful planning will 
always defeat rushed actions in the end.

GD-Ilmater~
Help Ilmater:
 
Ilmater is the Crying God, the god of endurance, suffering, martyrdom, and 
perseverance. It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in 
pain, oppressed, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes 
the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain.
 
He is the god of the oppressed and unjustly treated. In early days Ilmater's 
symbol was a blood stained rack, but of late a set of white hands bound by a 
blood red cord is used. The latter symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in 
the world at large. Ilmater dwells in the Twin Paradises. The followers of 
Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers, but in reality they 
offer a great deal along the "pure clerical" nature of healing and recovery to 
those who have been hurt.
 
They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual 
nature of life over the gross material body. Ilmater's priest are found where 
they are needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering 
to the needs of the opperessed, and the poor. They dress simply in gray, with 
gray skullcaps (blood red for the higher ranks).

Istishia is the god of elemental water.  While other gods, such as Umberlee
and Eldath, have dominion over differing aspects of water, Istishia embodies
water in all its facets (thus, these dieties can coexist with similiar but
technically different portfolios, abiding by the Overseer's mandate of unique
portfolios across the same pantheon).  Istishia's followers do not believe in
the widespread use of confrontation or force, but instead in slowly wearing
down the opposition, like water on a stone, and in following the path of 
least resistance, like water to the sea. He and his followers are the sworn
enemies of Kossuth. The domains associated with him are Destruction, Ocean,
Storm, Travel, and Water, and his favored weapon is the warhammer.
{x
Istishia's following in the Great Realms has been described as chaotic and
uncertain, much like the path of a raging river.  Istishia's faithful can be
found in various parts of the realms, with seemingly little else to unite
them other than their faith.

Help Kelemvor:
 
Kelemvor (KELL-ehm-vor)
 
Lord of the Dead, Judge of the Damned, Master of the Crystal Spire.
 
Kelemvor is the God of Death and the Dead.  He inherited these 
portfolios when Cyric lost them following the Cyrinishad debacle.
    Kelemvor is kind, just, forthright, and earnest, though stern at
times.  He tends to try and solve what he perceives as his immediate
problems with direct action.  He intends to impart justice among the
dead in an even-handed and fair manner. 
    He and Mystra shared a love affair during their mortal lives.  
Speculation exists as to whether this has continued into their godly 
tenure.
 
Kelemvor is interested in having followers who recognize that 
death is but a part of life.  It is not an end but a beginning, not 
a punishment, but a necessity.  There is no deceit in death, nothing
concealed, nothing chaotic.  Death is an orderly process.
    Kelemvor assisgns the essences of the dead their proper place in 
the ongoing cycle of existence, and it must be emphasized to all that 
he is the Great Guide, leading all folk to their next life. 
    Undeath is an affront to Kelemvor.  Undead creatures are to be 
destroyed or given true death whenever they are met with, and even 
sought out and hunted down for that holy purpose by the priests of 
Kelemvor, known as Doomguides.

hue. These disks are often cut of rose quatz or similar
minerals, or magically enchanted to radiata a pink glow dimly.
Lathander is portrayed in old texts and murals as a golden-skinned youth

{x
Queen of Spiders, Queen of the Demonweb Pits
{x
Lloth (sometimes spelled Lolth in the old script) is the drow deity of
Spiders, Evil, Darkness, Chaos, and Assassins.  She is most commonly
depicted as either a beautiful Drow female or as a huge spider. The whole
of the Drow society is based around an endless struggle to please her and
gain her favour and therefore advantage over other noble houses. She
revels in the ensuing anarchy of constantly changing power bases and
traiterous deeds commited by friend on friend.  Those who displease Lloth
are shown no mercy as justice is swift and metered out by her priestesses,
as her will is the will of the Drow society and those who rule it. Lloth
has her handmaidens - the Yochlol, to do her evil work for her, as well as
countless other minions.
{x
Worship to Lloth is limited to the drow, and centered around the drow
settlements, especially the Underdark and Menzoberranzan.  It is rare to
see open worship of Lloth in any other place, though a few progressive
societies are tolerant of temples erected in the name of the Spider
Queen.  Such temples are dark, damp and in many cases built below the
ground.  Those drow who call the Great Realms home can find a limited
venue of place for which they can openly worship their Queen.

{CLoviatar {w({cloh-VEE-a-tar{w)
{x
Maiden of Pain, The Willing Whip, Patroness of Torturers
{x
Loviatar is the aggressive, domineering and fearless patron of torturers,
sadists, and bullies. She has a cold and calculatingly cruel nature and an
icebound heart. The Maiden of Pain has an instinct for inflicting both
physical and psychological pain, always striking at the biggest chink in
her victim's emotional armor. Unlike most bullies, she does not feel pain
herself, but her plans often inherently rely on the innate selfishness of
human nature.
{x
Her church is dominated by females, of all races but primarily that of
humans and half-elves.  Worship is strongest in the large cities, such as
Waterdeep and Mirabar--places where bored and wealthy individuals are
easily recruited, and where such degenerate activities often go unnoticed.
Followers revel in torture, whether it be their enemies on the battlefield,
or the breaking of a young noble's heart amidst a passionate love affair.
Charisma, beauty and cunning are all traits that help those who work for
the Willing Whip see the most damage, physical and emotional.  Because of
the deceitful nature of their ways, worshipers of Loviatar often worship
in secret, or lead double lives, such that an exact handle on their numbers
in our Great Realms is unknown.  Her church is strong in many places, and
there is at least one cult following in every major city.

{x       /The Beastlord, Lord of Beasts, The Black-Blooded Pard\
{x       \ The Ravaging Bear, Master of the Hunt, Wild Hunter  /
 
Malar is the god of the savage wild.  He is worshipped by hunters who
revel in the kill or who hunt for sport or to excess, fallen rangers, sentient 
carnivores, and lycanthropes.  Those who suffer the  depredations of wild 
beasts attempt to placate The Beastlord with offerings of freshly killed and 
bloody meat, but Malar rarely recognizes their entreaties.  In his more 
favorable aspects he is revered by beings who identify with the untamed nature, 
grace, and amorality of predators.
 
Malar achieves almost sensuaal fulfillment from the hunt and the kill.  He 
revels in the fear radiated by the hunted and hungers for the blood of his
prey.
 
He speaks only in low growling undertone or vicious snarl.  The Lord of Beasts 
despises the Balance sought by druids and their deities and seeks to
overthrow it through the actions of his faithful.  He manifests an avatar
in Faerun in an endless hunt across the Realms whenever the mood strikes
him--which is almost constantly.

Myrkul is the god of the Dead, as opposed to the god of death, which is the
portfolio of Bhaal. Myrkul is described as speaking in a high whisper, always
alert yet manifesting itself in a cold, passive tone that is never anxious or
surprised. His influence is imposed through fear, and he is a master of
instilling fear in mortals through words and deeds.  He is the one deity that
almost all human mortals can picture clearly, as a cowled, skull head which
manifests itself in nightmares.
{x
The faith of Myrkul has never been popular, nor is its priests numerous. Many
venerated Myrkul out of fear, and offerings are made in his name at funerals
and other solemn occasions, but few actually worships him as their primary
faith. As such, there is no organized church or religion devoted to Myrkul in

have tought the first spellcaster of the realms, and to have enabled many of
the races to use magic. During the Time of Troubles Mystra was destroyed and
recreated as a mortal names Midnight who took the mantle of goddesshood and
the goddess's portfolio. At this time Mystra's stated alignment shifted from
Lawful neutral, maintaining the balance towards the udes and purpose of magic.
She retains her home among the clockwork plans of Nirvana, though whether she
will leave for a more goodly plane of find her own attitudes changed to reflect
her duties remains to be seen. She is aided in her work by Azuth, the god of
wizards. Mystra's symbol was a blue-white star before the coming of the
Avatars, and now is a circle of starts in a ring, with a red mist rising
towards the center. Both symbols are still in use. Unlike Cyric, Mystra seems
to be playing a long term game, for while she is as new a power as he, she has
taken all the trapping of her predecessor to keep the peace with her
worshippers. Before the time of Trouble, Mystra was portayed only as a prismatic
will-o-the-wisp,capable of using any spell known in the realms. Since

"President of the Tripower"
"Father of the Great Realms"
 
I am every nightmare every creature has ever had.  I am the dark thoughts 
of murder and treachery.  I am the cutting word that kills the soul and 
the bloody knife that kills the body.  I am the poison at the bottome of
the cup, the noose around the thief's neck, the cry of the wronged, and

madness.  I am Death and all things worse.  You know me.  We are old, old 
friends, you and I. [The Bible of Nightmares, Nisstyre 1:1]
 
Nisstyre was born on Toril, a full blooded drow who rised to the top
of his father's merchant guild, the Dragon's Hoard.  Killed at only the
age of 33 by a female drow priest, Nisstyre was reborn five years later
by the Red Wizards of Thay.  The wizards ordered him as payment for his
life back to retrieve a very powerful magical relic from a small island
in the Sea of Swords.  Nisstyre left the city of Waterdeep in search of
the island, but his ship never made it.  The ship ripped through the
barriers and entered the forgotten world created by Ao.  Nisstyre died
along with a fellow passanger, and life was given to the world.  Ao
rewarded Nisstyre and Teron for their death, with immortality and the
power to mold his forgotten world into their own, and so they did.
 
Nisstyre is known as the god of Nightmares, as he rules over any
nightmare in the realm.  The only other title he takes in the realms
of immortality is "Father of the World" along side with Teron, for
creating the Great Realms.  Nisstyre also takes up his father's guild,

white snowwood. His home plane is  Concordant Opposition, the plane of the
truest neutrality. His domain is called the House Of Knowledge. Much as
Mystra of old was said to sit in judgement of each new spell, Oghmn is said
to decide whether a new idea would be known to the world or confined to its
originator. Oghma is the most powerful god of Knowledge in the realms.
Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors for Oghma, carrying the new
information both to him and to those whom Oghma favors.

The Red Knight is venerated within the church of Tempus, but always in a

clasped in her hands.

The clergy of the Red Knight, known as the Red Fellowship, is an offshoot
of a monastic order within the hierarchy of the church of Tempus that
concentrated on planning and strategy. The appearance of the Red Knight in
the Great Realms has been sporadic, but always accompanied by the
appearance of Tempus himself, whether his avatar or visions of the Lord of
Battles. In recent times, few accounts are told of witnessing Tempus'
incarnation, and none have said to have seen the Red Knight in many years
following her Lord's disappearance.  There is no evidence that the Red
Knight holds any firm following in the Great Realms, but it is rumored that
if a cult and temple were established in her name, she would return to the

{x
Rillifane Rallathil is quiet, reflective, and enduring over eons
unchanged, sometimes even described as grave and self-absorbed. The
Leaflord is protector of the woodlands and guardian of the harmony of
nature. He is often likened by his clerics to a giant oak tree, so huge
that its roots mingle with the roots of every other plant in the world.
The great tree draws into itself all the ebb and flow of seasons and
lives within the woodlands of the green elves.  At the same time, it
defends and sustains those lands against disease, predation, and
assaults of all kinds. The Leaflord is the patron of wood elves (and to
a much lesser extent wild elves).
{x
With the fall of Myth Drannor and surrounding elven holdings, and with
the scattering of the wood elves, much of Rillifane's organized clergy
has also scattered and faded into legend.  It has been reported that in
the wilds of the ancient elven lands, the faithful of the Leaflord still
gather twice a year at the equinoxes, at the largest grove of oaks of
the forest, to hold prayer and celebration for their god.

that influences the tides, changes lycanthropes, orders reproductive

Selune approaches existence with the placid calm of dappled moonlight.
Like the moon itself, the quietly mystical Lady of Silver has many faces.
At times, she seems distant, cloaked in the sadness of past defeats and
tragedies. At others, she dances joyfully, her lithe form glowing with
majestic radiance. Her time is occupied with the ceaseless war against
Shar, for the fate of all Toril in which both had a hand in creating
and infusing with life. 
{x
Worshipers of Selune are numerous throughout the Great Realms, especially
among seafarers and explorers.  It is often through Selune that people of
a diverse background find commonality and fellowship.  She is such a far
reaching deity that most good-hearted Faerunians respect her clergy, who
are mostly women, and pay homage to her when the moon is full. Expecially
in latter times when adventurers are revered, Selune holds a strong
following for those looking to find their way.

Shaundakul is a lonely deity of few words who lets his deeds speak for him.
He is kind but stern, with a rugged sense of humor that sometimes comes to
the fore. His faith is on the upswing in part because of his willingness
to personally recruit worshipers while manifesting in the world in physical
form. Clad in his dark, swirling cloak, leather armor, and boots that never
quite touch the ground, the Rider of the Winds cuts a regal figure with his
massive greatsword ever at the ready. Tall and handsome, Shaundakul walks
in silence but is surrounded by the ever-present keening whistle of the
wind.
{x
Shaundakul's church faded to obscurity following the Fall of Myth Drannor.
With the discovery of many of his ancient shrines also came the discovery
of several groups of isolated cultures still engaging in worship for the
Rider of the Winds.  It was in these discoveries that Shaundakul's Avatar
returned to the Great Realms to encourage the exploration and rediscovery
of his religion. Today, many include Shaundakul in their daily prayers,

others with them as possible.  Talassans are taught that life is a 
combination of random effects and chaos, so the devout should grab what they

Tchazzar is a cryptic deity, whose story seems to be that of hero turned
to evil.  Early accounts depict Tchazzar as a man, strong and iconic, who
fought to unite the kingdom of Chessenta.  As king, he ruled Chessenta for
many years, until one day he rode north and disappeared, never to be seen
again.  Or so it was told.  Shortly after the discovery of the gateway
linking the Great Realms to the Astral Plains, accounts of a dragon's lair
began to circulate.  Heroes gathered together to investigate, and what they
found was striking.  The lair housed a vast treasure, and guarded by no
less than six dragons: Five of the chromatic races and one Dragon Queen who
ruled over them all.  This Dragon Queen was described by the writings on
the walls of the lair as the incarnation of Tchazzar himself.  As it turned
out,  it was the other way around, for Tchazzar was actually a Dragon first
who saw the opportunity to become a deity.  She posed the experiment that
if she assumed human form and did great deeds, a cult would be created to
worship her, giving her immortal powers. Her experiment worked.
{x
Tchazzar is not openly worshiped in the Great Realms, but yet still holds
near god-like powers.  All of her power comes from her cult, which still
venerates her (as their king) in the kingdom of Chessenta (her incarnation
as a man seems to have been a means of obtaining kingship).  She is still
very much mortal according to hero accounts, suggesting that her cult in
latter times is faltering.

split into two beings in the Dawn Cataclysm, a war among the gods that long 
preceded the Time of Troubles and is said to have heralded the fall of Myth
Drannor. Beshaba garnered more of Tyche's wanton, willful nature, sensual side,

Tymora's faith is one of the most common in the great Faerun, in particular
since it caters most heavily to a highly mobile, relatively wealthy, and 
intrinsically powerful group who live by their wits and by their luck: 
adventurers. Tymora is fickle but playful and never vengeful or malicious. She
likes a good joke and has been known to play an occasional practical joke on 
some of the more straight-laced deities, such as Helm and Tyr
 
She is reputed by sages to have had short-lived romances with several of the

Umberlee is the terror of sailors and coastal dwellers across the world.
She breaks agreements on a whim and takes great pleasure in watching
others die by drowning or in the jaws of sea predators. Vain and desirous
of flattery, she is excessively greedy for power and revels in exercising
it. The Bitch Queen is always depicted as a female blue-green torso garbed
in shells and a mauve cape made from jellyfish rising out of the waves
with taloned hands, elbow fins, eyes of pale pearly death, and hair of
kelp. Like the church of Talos, the church of Umberlee is almost
universally despised and propitiated only out of fear. Nevertheless,
nearly every sailor makes an offering to the Bitch Queen before heading
into her domain and Umberlant clerics can walk unmolested in dockside wards
in most ports. They are even welcomed aboard most ships, in hopes that
their presence will help appease the Bitch Queen. 
{x
Worship of Umberlee has not taken root in the Great Realms.  This may be
because of the relatively calm waters that characterize much of the

Umberlee's influence.  However, sailors still respect her, and in places
such as Baldur's Gate, Umberlee is still revered almost with a detached
admiration.

{x
The Vaunted, Archmage of Necromancy, Lord of the Forsaken Crypt
{x
Velsharoon is a vain, selfish, petty, but very canny deity consumed with
vengeance, obsessed with experimenting on living and dead beings, and
unconcerned with the fates of lesser creatures. In many ways he continues to
act like the mortal he recently was, albeit with far greater power at his
disposal than before. His power in the Great Realms is limited, owed almost
exclusively to the storm god Talos, who sponsored his existence in these
realms.
{x
Followers of Velsharoon are few and far between.  Any organized structure to
his faith exists only within isolated groups that engage in activities which
seek to understand and expand the faith's collective knowledge of life, death,
and undeath.  As such, their faith activities include grave robbing, embalming,
necromancy teaching and practice.  Reports of Velsharoon's loyal within the
Great Realms have been few to none.

Merchants Friend
{x
Waukeen is a relatively young, vibrant, vivacious, deity who is eager to get
things done. She loves wealth not for itself but for what can be done and
acquired with it. She enjoys bargaining and the hustle and bustle of the
marketplace. She rules over deals done above and below the rabble - legitimate
as well as black market commerce. She is interested in innovation, but can
also be stubborn and persistent, which sometimes gets her into trouble. 
{x
Waukeen's church is very popular among the coastal cities, especially those
within the land of Sembia.  The religion has had a slow arrival in the Great
Realms, owing to the persistent rumors surrounding Waukeen's sudden
disappearance many years prior.

Help Yuna:
 
Yuna is the goddess of darkness, night, loss and forgetfulness. Like Cyric
she is neutral and evil in nature and resides in the extradimensional plane
of Hades. She is worshipped by those who deal in the night, who hate the light,
and who feel bitterness and loss.
 
She will hurt you if you come to her attention, stay away from her, fear her,
and quietly praise her.

mana movement hitpoints mv~
HP, Mana, and Move (MV) are the basic three defining characteristics
of everything on the mud. They can be found listed in the {Cscore{x
command.
{x
HP is the amount of health a character has. Every time you gain
a level, you will gain 1-50 HP based upon your class, race, stats,
and a random amount of luck. Whenever you do damage to something,
or it damages you, the amount of damage is done directly to HP.
{x
Mana is of primary importance to spell casters as it dictates how
many spells can be cast. Each spell, and a few skills, require a
certain amount of Mana before they can be used. Like HP, it goes
up every time you level.
{x
Move points, or movement, is the distance one can move before they
become exhausted. It varies depending on terrain; a city street
requires less moves than a mountain trail. Also, certain spells,
such as fly, make it easier to move about. Movement increases with
level.

Buff Nerf Troll MMORPG~
The following are commonly used terms (slang) utilized in the internet
gaming subculture, namely MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role playing
games). While not a complete and exhaustive list, this serves as a start
for someone who is new to the gaming culture, or likewise a reference for
anyone interested.
{Y
Buff {R- {wTo make stronger (increase stats) via spells.  Opposite of nerf
 (see below). Also as a noun, the spells which makes one stronger (buffs).
{c
 "Can someone buff me up real quick?  I need to retrieve my corpse."
{Y
Nerf {R- {wTo weaken or handicap. Used commonly in regards to online games,
where developers handicap one aspect of the game (the characters, items,
areas, etc) in an attempt to establish balance.  Supposedly, this term
originated from an online game called Ultima Online, where the developers
dramatically lowered the damage of a sword object, causing players to
refer to it as "nerfed" like a Nerf bat (foam toy) in regards to how
little damage it caused afterwards.
{c
 "The imms nerfed wizards again.  Guess I'll play my merc."
{Y
Troll {R- {wReferring to an individual who posts provocative messages on a forum
or message board for the sole purpose of starting arguments.  Can also refer
to a player of an online game who goes out of their way to make the game
miserable for other players and staff, be it through their actions or
comments/posts.  Not to be confused with a flamer (see below).
{c
 "Troll:  This place sucks.  I hate everyone here.  Damn the newbies too."
{Y
Flame, Flamer {R- {wPosts or replies in response to a comment, delivered in an
argumentative or negative way (insulting).  A flamer may or may not have a
legitimate argument, but oftentimes they don't.
{c
 "Your last post was dumb.  Quit wasting the board space."

The Mud automatically determines an age for your character based
upon the number of hours you have played. It begins at 19 and
increases with every 20 hours of active game time. This number
can be found in {Cscore{x and also in {Cfinger{x.

0 misc_align~
align alignment repent curse~
Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react
to situations. There's good, neutral, and evil alignment. Your alignment
is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil monster
and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and you head
towards the dark side of things.
{x
Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure evil),
with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly evil nor wholly
good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. You can check your
alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW
ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment of others.
{x
Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, in some cases, what exits
you see.  The Temple of Thoth houses recall for good and high-neutral aligned
characters.  The Temple of Belan is home to those of evil and low-neutral
alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment will be "zapped"
off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good alignment, on occasion,
Thoth will protect you from harm in battle (usually from teleport spells),
but Belan, being evil, leaves his followers to fend for themselves.
{x
Should you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in Westbridge
near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the appropriate
priest for the alignment you wish to become.

0 misc_bot~
Botting~
-------------------
DEFINITION OF A BOT
-------------------
{x
  A bot is a pfile that runs automatically from a series of scripts
and or triggers, allowing the pfile to function within the mud
allowing it to -do- things.  Thus such activities are found to take
away the game-play of the mud, therefore bots are illegal.
{x
  It has not been made illegal to have and run such scripts, but
they can only be ran while under the supervision of the pfile's
owner, aka the Player.  This means you cannot leave your pfile
to run such scripts while you go watch TV, cook dinner, buy drugs, etc.
You are to be at the minimum WATCHING what your character is doing.
The reason for this is, in past cases, bots have gotten out of control
and allowed people to cheat during pk and other random things.
{x
  Such scripts, for example, are triggers and scripts that allow you
to level, do quests, and/or practise skills.  These are examples, but
in general if the series of scripts allow your pfile to "further"
someone via money, quest points, skills, spells, equipment or
anything else of mud-value it is considered a bot.
{x
{x  Once again, HAVING and USING these scripts/triggers -IS- legal.
{x  NOT WATCHING YOUR CHARACTER WHILE THESE SCRIPTS RUN = ILLEGAL.
{x
  Simple triggers such as eating, drinking, and recasting spells on
yourself are not considered bot-ish.  This means you can be away
from your computer and still have these triggers run.  Such triggers
do not "further" any character in the game, only maintain health and
balance.
{x
  As any rule of Waterdeep, the staff does hold the right to determine
certain factors, but a trigger to scratch your ass anytime someone
walks into the room is not illegal.

Bracket~
Brackets are those things you see after someone's character name. 
They appear like [OP4L] and other things, but do not include such
brackets as [MA] [RPT] and [Wanted].  Brackets are set by immortals,
and you can pay to have one placed on your character.  Brackets must
be no more then 20 characters long, including spaces, and must be in a
roleplaying fashion.  Stupid brackets will not be formed.  
 
Please note that brackets disappear after you reroll and will not be
reset for free.
 
Pricing:
1k platinum per character + 500 platinum per color change if you
provide the color codes, 1k if you do not.
(Note that, just as mentioned above, a space IS a character.)
 
If you wish to purchase a bracket, please contact an immortal.

0 misc_calendar~
Calendar~
The realms of Waterdeep adopts the same calendar used in the
Forgotten Realms (FR), of which much of the MUD is based. The FR
calendar is very similiar to the Gregorian calendar (the calendar
we are used to), having 365 days in a year and 12 months in a
year.  Each month consists of 30 days, divided into 3, ten day
weeks (called rides).  The remaining 5 days of the year fall at
the end of selected months.  Leap years are retained and the
extra day is set aside as a day of council, revitalizing
alliances and pacts, and also a day of competition.  Below is the
conversion table between the Gregorian and FR calendars:

0 misc_days~
Days~
The following are descriptions of the special days that fall
throughout the Forgotten Realms calendar year (see HELP Calendar
for a list of these days):
{x
Midwinter - Nobles and monarchs greet the halfway point of winter
with a feast they call the High Festival of Winter. Traditionally
it is the preferred day to make or renew alliances. For common
folk, this day represents the halfway point of winter, which they
call the Deadwinter Day, and is not favored by them.
{x
Greengrass - The official beginning of Spring is a day of peace
and rejoicing. Even if snow still covers the ground, clerics,
nobles, and wealthy folk make a point of bringing out flowers
grown in special rooms within temples and castles. They distribute
the flowers among the people, who wear them or cast them upon the
ground as bright offerings to the deities who summon the Summer.
{x
Midsummer - Midsummer night is a time of feasting and music and
love. It is a common time for meeting neighbors and having
gatherings, and a popular day for weddings.  Good weather is
expected and bad weather is taken as an omen of ill fortune ahead.
{x
Highharvestide - This holiday of feasting to celebrate the autumn
harvest also marks a time of journeys. Traditionally, travelers
leave this day, after feasting and before rain freezes into snow.
{x
The Feast of the Moon - The Feast of the Moon celebrates ancestors
and the honored dead. Stories of ancestor's exploits mix with the
legends of deities until it's hard to tell one from the other.
{x
Shieldmeet - Once every four years, another day is added to the
year (in the manner of February 29 in the Gregorian calendar).
This day is part of no month and follows Midsummer Night. This
very special day is a day of open council between nobles and
people, a day for making and renewing pacts, oaths, and agreements.
It is also a day for tournaments, tests, and trials for those
wishing to advance in fame (or infamy).

Death~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Westbridge.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.
{x
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
{x
Following and groups are not affected by death.
{x
You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.
{x
Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

Bongs Weed Cigars Cigarettes Drugs Pills~
Along with the standard assortment of consumable items,
such as food and drink, there are also the "recreational"
items that can be found throughout the game.  Some of
these, such as pills and drugs, give actual effects to
your character when eaten (eat <name of drug or pill>),
in the form of spells (which can be seen using a spell
of identify on the object).  Other items, such as bongs, 
weed, cigars and cigarettes are brought to you for the
fun and amusement that these items can bring, but offer
no incentive in terms of stats or affects.  
{x
Bongs and weed are used together.  Cigars and
cigarettes act just like the other lights in the game:

0 misc_dupe~
Dupe Duped~
By popular demand, here is an explanation of what exactly a "dupe" is,
when talking about items on the MUD (e.g. duped eq), and what to do
if you suspect or know you have a duped object.
{x
Dupe is short for duplication, but also a word meaning to deceive,
which is appropriate for this particular situation.  (i've been duped
by a dupe, dangit).
{x
A dupe (or duped item/object) is an EXACT copy, down to the creation
time, of an object on the MUD.  There are some cases where this occurs
normally (mass item resetting, multiple item buying, etc.) but we
refer to a dupe as an object copy that was made ILLEGALLY, through
abusing a bug in the game (immortal dupe checks take into account
these legal copies).
{x
Currently, no known bugs exist that can lead to duped objects, and the
immortal staff is hard at work to remove the last remaining duped
objects from the game, created over many years of previous bug abuse,
intentional and accidental.  All items carry a timestamp that only
immortals can see, which makes finding and tracking dupes relatively
easy.  The odds of you getting a dupe by accident is very low (as is
the odds that someone intentionally selling you a duped item will get
away with it).
{x
What to do if you think you have a duped object:
{x
If you are contacted by an immortal regarding an object you have that
is duped, you should have it destroyed, either by your own means, or
with the help of an immortal (duped objects you are known to possess
may be subject to forceful removal, with or without your being logged
in.  Such action will only be taken for excessive numbers of dupes, or
for objects that are "high profile" meaning powerful and valuable.
Thus it is to your advantage to destroy or have destroyed as many
duped objects as you are found to have, to decrease the chance that
they will be forcefully removed).  
{x
If you suspect you have a dupe, created through an in game bug. Ask
first a mortal administrator or immortal to see if this is a
possibility, as the chances of this happening are extremely low. If
likely, report the incident, with specifics, in a note to the
immortals.  The incident will be looked into and you will receive a
reply note about the progress made.
{x
If you suspect you were sold a duped item, or given one without your
knowledge.  First have proof, or substantial evidence to support
your claim.  Then post a note to the immortals with all evidence, and
it will be investigated.  Intentionally selling duped objects is
considered bug abuse (misuse of a bug created item), and carries with
it a harsh punishment. 
{x
For completeness of this file, the known bugs that lead to dupes are:
weight-drop duplication bug upon logoff, MUD nosave crash leading to
corpse/object copying.  Until recently, the former still existed in
the game.

0 misc_experience~
Experience Level XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.
{x
You gain experience by:
{x
{x    being part of a group that kills a monster
{x
You lose experience by:
{x
{x    fleeing from combat
{x    recalling out of combat
{x    being the target of certain spells
{x    dying
{x
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

FreePK~
When in a room marked FREEPK, every character is considered a
player kill character. This means that regardless of PK status
and clan, you can be attacked, stolen from, and are vulnerable
to PK actions. Entering FREEPK is at your own risk; if you die,
your corpse will be open to looting by your killer. All usual
PK rules apply to every character when in FREEPK areas.
{x
Remember, entering FREEPK means you are no longer protected.
While there are rules in place regarding luring into these
areas, do not expect any reimbursement if you go in willingly.

Hitroll Damroll~
Your hitroll determines how likely you are to hit an

Your damroll, likewise, determines how much damage you
do to an enemy on a regular, unarmed hit. It also
factors into the damage done by weapons and by certain
skills. Both numbers are better when higher and can
be affected by equipment.

0 misc_run~
Runs Claimed~
A "Run" can be any area of section of an area that is designated
by an immortal as such. Usually it will contain some valuable prize
and will typically requiremore than one person to complete. These
are also typically recognized by the fact that they can be claimed
by a person or group, and are generally not available one they are
completed until they are manually reset or the mud reboots.
{x
Waterdeep's major runs, usually aimed at heroes, are listed in the
{Gclaimed{x command. This will list the runs, by name, and whether
they are available. Runs marked as Open or Reset are available to
be claimed currently; runs marked as Closed are not yet available.
If a player name is listed, that means that a current group has
claimed and is either attempting or has attempted that run.
{x
You may not interfere with a run currently in progress by entering
the area, taking items off the ground, etc. PK is also prevented
within the confines of the run. If the entire group leaves the run
area by any means, purposefully or by dying, that run is open to
be claimed by another group. 
{x
{RNOTE{x: The groups formed for a run are up to you and are at your

Tick~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.
{x
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on Waterdeep average 2 minutes of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 1 minute 45 secs and 2 minutes 15 secs.
{x
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 misc_tier~
Tiers Second-Tier~
Waterdeep has two different tiers of classes. First tier, available
upon initial creation, is a foundation class to aquaint players
to the mud and give players a feel for what their character can do.
{x
A second tier of classes is available to characters upon reaching
hero (101) in first tier. It is not required to become second tier,
but these classes are more powerful then their first tier
counterparts. By rerolling your character ({Chelp reroll{x) you can
recreate as a new, unlocked class. This is essentially recreating,
with the following changes:
{x
- These classes have 10% less experience per level.
- They gain skills and spells at lower levels.
- When killing a mob, they receive experience for a mob 5 levels lower.
{x
Also, there are some skills and spells which are only available to
a second tier class that was not available in first tier. Also,
second tier classes gain hero skills at level 101 which are both
powerful and unique to that class.
{x
It is not required to reroll into the "matching" second tier class of
your first tier character. A first tier warrior is free to reroll
into a second tier wizard if they wish.
{x
All classes, matching first and second tier counterparts, are listed
in {Chelp classes{x.

Exotic Weapons Weapon Weaponmaster Axe Dagger Flail Mace Polearm Spear Sword Whip~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.
{x
The weapon skills consist of the following:

ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.
{x
Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.
{x
The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:
{x
Socials --
{x    Kelsey and Liralen
{x
New, Improved Valhalla --
{x    Liralen
{x
Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
{x    Seth
{x
Maps and map shop --
{x    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)
{x
Nirvana zone --
{x    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)
{x
Mob Factory --
{x    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)
{x
Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
{x    Alander
{x
Ideas and playtesting --
{x    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world
{x
Beta testing --
{x    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
{x    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches
{x
New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files
{x
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. 
{x
The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.
{x
Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

{x  Waterdeep was founded as a Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Mud,
original as a Rom 2.4 but four days after opening switched to the
RoT 1.4 Codebase.  We mixed our Forgotten Realms based theme with
that of Final Fantasy 6 and 7.  In 1998 a hacker sucessfully entered
our systems and destroyed 75% of the system files, repairs were made
by Synwulfe which turned WD into a Hybrid of Rot 1.4 and the
unreleased Rot 1.5b2.  Since our opening we have taken the time to
improve and repair the Rot codebase, roughly the entire source code
has been rewritten, despite the fact many functions remain the same.
The mud opened with 6000 rooms, and as of 2005 had over 30,000 rooms
and countless additions.

|                    The World of Player Killing                    | 03/14/10
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{x
  Player Killing or "PK" is the act of one player attacking another player,
which in the game of WaterdeepMUD is optional.  You are required to go PK
before passing level 40, and will be notified at Level 39 about setting your
PK status.  You are not required to go PK during 1st tier.
{x
  Being a PKiller means you are open to attack from other Pkillers within a
+/- 5 level range (Example if you are level 50, then anyone from 45 to 55
can be attacked or attack you).  Joining a clan is not required to become
PK.  When you do become PK and are not already in a clan, you will be placed
in the Loner Guild.
{x
  The PKILLSET command is used to set your Pk Status.  You are given three
main options in the world of PK, [PK] Pure PK, [TPK] Toggle Pkiller, or
[TNPK] Toggle NPKer.  If you wish to remain pure npk, then do not use this
command.
{x
  [PK] or Pure PK means that you are always in the realm of Player Killing
and do not have the option to use the toggle function.
{x
  [TPK] or Toggle Pkiller means that you are PK by default, but have the
option to toggle into being a NPKer for 200 hours/ticks.
{x
  [TNPK] or Toggle NPKer means that you are NPK by default, but have the
option to toggle into being a PKer for 200 hours/ticks.
{x
  When you are killed during PK, you will create a corpse and a fist.  The
corpse is open to be looted, while the fist belongs to the victim only.
The corpse contains what is known as a 'Loot Bonus' which are items that
you have won by fighting and killing another player.
{x
  Pure PKillers [PK] get a Loot Bonus of 3 items minimum, and 6 items max.
  Togglers get a Loot Bonus of 1 item minimum, and 3 items max.
{x
  Type PKILLSET for complete instructions on how to use this command.
{x
  For more information, please read the following help files:
{x
HELP CLANS  -  Info about Clans, how to join and their functions.

|                   WaterdeepMUD Project: Airships                  | 10/24/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cleaning up airships and possibly restricting how many people can own, the
current system is riddled with old airships of players who are no longer
active and ships which are just not used, giving us roughly 300 to 500 ships
in the system which may be causing game errors.  Prime example is the teleport
function which is not working right, people use this function only to have
someone elses ship teleport.  Since the system went active, we have had a
problem with ownership and indentification of ships between players and their
own ship, mud tends to confuse ships.
{x
  Solution A - Removal of all unactive ships, restricting ownership to only
one or two ships (purchasing back unneeded ships from active players), and
reinforcing the no-storage aspect.
{x
  Solution B - Total ovahul of our airship system, which in the end would make
it more healthier for the game AND probably be more beneficial to the game.
There are multiple problems with the current airship system, namely in how the
ships are created.  Ships are currently built from scratch upon bootup of the
game, basic structure of ships are kept in template files, while the unique
data such as items, ship equipment, descriptions and so forth are kept in a
different file.  When the game boots, it creates the ships in a block of vnums
and spawns them at random, meaning the room vnums are changed every few boots,
which has caused problems with items on ships.  Along with this data, any item
on the ship is also freshly created.  This 'virtual' area system has caused
many problems besides listed above includes problems of the ship to owner
indentification, mud tends not to reconize the ship, or like the teleport drive
does something to another ship.  This overhaul would call for the destruction
of all current airships and overhaul how ships are created and saved.
{x
  Using the original airship system created by Thunder and lost when he left
the mud, airships would be hard code area like any other zone on the mud.
Since we do not allow storage of items on ships, a hard coded zone would act
like any other zone, items wouldn't save when dropped.  But because the hard
coded zone would have static vnums, eq lockers could be placed on the ship.
Airships could be more customizable due to the property system, which could
be applied to the airship so people could customize their rooms, but also
could construct the ship in the shape they want it, so in theory when you
buy a ship, it would be 1 room with +49 ones you could build onto it.
{x
  Most of the airship code would probably hook up to this new spawning and
saving method with some editing of course.  Remove the engine concept since
there was really no big difference in speeds, revamp weapon and hitpoint
system.
{x
  Solution B of course would be a much longer road, but this new spawning
technique would probably allow for more interaction with airships, such as
mortal manned cannons not on an airship and or possibly mobile attacks.

|             WaterdeepMUD Project: Clan Revamp 2009               | 10/24/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Clan Revamp is a major overhaul of the clan system and how the system
works.  It includes a change in code on how npk/pk works, the removal and
replacement of all clans and clan halls, and the removal of factions.  There
are several points to why we are removing and replacing clans and removing
factions totally.
{x
 -  Factions are to be removed as the concept of npk/pk being together in
 one group will be done with clans now.  Also because the main purpose behind
 the Factions was the entire concept of people running cities and declaring
 war on each other, a system which isn't going to show up anytime soon.  Its
 also felt that Clans could do the same, in the end.
{x
 -  Removal and Replacement of all clans namely because they have been around
 forever, and despite tradition, its a new era of time for the mud and its
 time for some major changes to the game.  An RP reason will be developed to
 why these clans will disappear for our roleplayers, and how the new clans
 come into play.  Old clans will be recorded into the pfiles and displayed in
 the finger command as a record to the game history.  Clan Halls will be
 converted into public zones so they are not wasted.
{x
  The following are the changes and project notes that are occuring with this
revamp, and are subject to change.
{x
  -  All but 2 clans will become 'Combo Clans' which will allow both npk and
 pk players to be members under one banner (like factions).  The remaining
 2 clans will be kept purely NPK but optional to become combo in the future.
{x
  -  Config PK will be an available option to all players except Outlaws and
 the pure NPK clans.  Players will be allowed to switch their characters back
 and forth between NPK and PK, under the restriction that once the command is
 used once, there will be a major delay before it will be usable again, such
 as 24 hours for example.
{x
  -  There will be a 'Membership' allocation per month which means that a
 clan will only be able to recruit <?> amount of players per month.
{x
  -  There will be <?> active leaders per clan, and no person will be a leader
 of more than one clan.
{x
  -  There will be 8 clans, 3 Good, 1 Neutral and 4 Evil.  6 Will be combo
 clans while 1 Good and 1 Evil clan will remain true npk.

|                 WaterdeepMUD Project: Mud Cleanup                 | 10/24/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mud Cleanup Project is a very simple project in which we reward players with
a few AP points for finding errors or bugs within the mud, not including spell
checking room descriptions.  Namely Rooms which are not complete, be it a
stupid room name, builders notes in the description and or no descriptions at
all.  Also includes checking the help files and updating what is needed, and
other 'outter' appearances of the mud.  Main goal is we wish to request that
MudConnector does another review of the game, as if you check, we were the
first mud to be reviewed by MudConnector back in 1998, but of course we were
a major mess as pointed out, good review though for the time.  Also just to
clean up the game after 12 years of development.
{x
  General idea is 1 to 5 ap points, but of course it will have to be on the
first come, first awarded system as people will find the same errors until
they are fixed and updated.  Solution is a coded command that will record
these errors, and that mortals can check, possibly using one of the note
boards.  Command needs to be developed so mortals can check when vnum a room
is outside of a property zone, so immortals can quickly find the room and
fix whatever problem.

Avian Avians~
The avian race is a very secretive and mysterious one.  They are
the size of giants, towering over any human, but weigh about the same
as an elf.  Their slight bone structure allows their wings to carry
them as they fly from place to place, but it also requires them to
rely on mental prowess instead of brawn for survival.  Many speculate
that they are a people who evolved in the mountains, perhaps
magically.  However they came to be, they are fiercely religious, and
worship a nature diety.  Most choose to become druids since that
allows them to be closest to their god, however they do well in
clerical magicks as well.  They have uncanny powers of sight, and it
is said that an avian can see everything you do.  For this reason many
avians are hired as watchkeepers, and they make wonderful explorers
and missionaries.  Their amazingly unusual bodies, which basically
look like emaciated humans with wings, and the fact that they are used
to an isolated environment, makes them very susceptible to disease and
poison.  Many an avian has ventured out of his or her homeland only to
fall victim to one of the many plagues that ravage the world at large.

Draconian~
The draconians are a fearsome race, and almost as secretive as the avians.
Like the avians, they can fly, and come from some not-so-well-known place
far away.  Unlike any other race though, draconians are not mammalian.
They more closely resemble lizards, snakes, and especially dragons.
They tower over even giants in size, reaching over 12 feet in height, with
leathery wings that can stretch to over 30 feet when extended, and can fold
up neatly on the back, causing no real hindrance in movement.  The sheer
size of a draconian DOES, however, cause problems, because most things in
the world are built with human size in mind.  Draconians are very strong,
and tougher even than dwarves.  Unlike most races that reach such large
proportions, they retain a keen mind, and make good mages as well as
warriors.  Because of their strange biology, and some degree of reptilian
nature, draconians are immune to almost all poisons and plagues.

Dwarf Dwarves~
Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great
stamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.
They are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long 
lifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages or thieves.

Elf Elves~
Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They
lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more agile,
both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at
best fair talent as warriors or priests.
{x
Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from the
use of iron or steel in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously 
hard to spot, and so elven warriors and thieves recieve the sneak and hiding
automatically. They may see in the dark with infravision.

Giant Giants~
Giants are the largest of the races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They
are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  
They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy
than the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are
ill-suited for any other profession.
{x
Giants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,
their slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,
due to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for
free. (Only giant warriors recive bash).

Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely

greenish grey skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish-grey to
dull yellow mane.

0 race_gnome~
Gnome Gnomes~
Gnomes are to dwarves what pixies are to elves.  That is to say, they are
smaller, smarter, less-strong cousins.  Where dwarves are known for their
mental dullness but great wisdom, gnomes are known for quick minds and a
very analytical nature.  They are nowhere near as strong or hearty as
dwarves are, but are much the same, being creatures of earth who can't
swim (and thus drown easily like dwarves) and have eyes attuned to seeing
in the dark.  Where a dwarf would see a mine shaft and it's glittering
jewels, though, a gnome notices the girders and struts and supports within
the mine and contemplates ways to make them better.  Gnomes love technology,
metallurgy, and any other form of science.  This makes them natural mages,
possessing mental powers that rival elves.  They are not, however, a stealthy
race like elves, goblins, or halflings.  They are engineers, architects,
artisans, and sometimes workers of great magicks.

0 race_goblin~
Goblin Goblins~
Goblins are almost universally shunned because they are almost all natural
criminals, cutthroats, and killers.  Every crime boss or thief master is a
goblin, with very few exceptions.  They are extremely thrifty, known to
argue over a single silver piece, and will drop water in the desert before
dropping money. Goblins have diabolical minds, and few torture devices can
be named which a goblin did not think up.  They are extremely smart and also
have a knack for survival.  Stealth comes naturally to them, and their dusky
grey to green, sometimes even blue or black, skin tones make them hard to
spot at night.
{x
Goblins are not really warlike, and don't really appreciate overt combat.
It's not their style.  A goblin would much rather satisfy its sadistic needs
through thievery or betrayal than through honorable combat.

0 race_halfelf~
HalfElf HalfElves~
Halfelves are a cross between a human and an elf, usually due to the fact
that human armies sometime make raids on elf lands. Halfelves are very
nearly human, although they tend to be a bit more thoughtful, and less
physically powerful.  Unfortunately they are also more bitter, and much
more aloof than either the most secretive elf or the most secluded human
hermit.  They see themselves as unwelcome in either elf or human society
and as a result tend to lead solitary lives as wandering adventurers who
follow no real creed.
{x
A halfelf is a natural loner, and most of them are rangers or druids,
communing with the nature that they love much as the elves do.
They have much better eyesight than humans, due to their elven ancestry,
but unlike elves are more inquisitive about the world around them, much
as humans are.

Halfling Halflings~
Halflings are a quiet folk who like to keep to themselves, and are not
often seen filling the role of an adventurer.  They would much rather
sit complacently by a fireplace enjoying a good book, good drink, and
good conversation.  They are, however, very adept thieves, and have the
mental capabilities to be quite powerful mages.  They are about half
as tall as the average human, thus the name halfling.  Because of this
small size and the fact that most devices are built to human proportions,
halflings are masters at lockpicking, disarming traps, and jewel craft.
They also have very easy access to pockets, and there is no door a
halfling can not open and slip through with the utmost of silence.

HalfOrc HalfOrcs~
Halforcs are a cross between humans and orcs, dwarves and orcs, or sometimes
even giants and orcs.  These various combinations are almost always the result
of an orc raid on the habitation of one of those other races, and each type of
halforc is just as mean and hearty as the other.  They are also very agile,
and born athletes, however seldom is a halforc found that can even read or
speak coherently.  They are quite literally dumber than bricks, but there is
no more fearsome fighter around.
{x
A halforc is a warrior, and if a halforc is not a warrior, then that halforc
is useless.  They can fight, and when it suits them they can also sleep, eat,
and fornicate, but that's it.

brown to black while their body colouring varies as would a normal normal

Pixies are very much like the elves...and share with them a vulnerability
to iron weapons.  They also share the nature-loving attitude and peaceful
demeanor, but beyond this pixies reach an extreme.  They are extremely
magical creatures which, unlike elves, fly everywhere they go.  Their
wings are fairly redundant, as they don't really use them to fly.  It's
the sheer magical nature of a pixie that gives it it's special qualities.
{x
They are a race of very small size, and because of their inquisitive
nature and mental power, tend also to be tinkerers and sometimes
pranksters.  While a pixie may be thousands of years old, almost all
of them act like human children...

became worthless and were abandoned when the mines lost all value. 
{x   Although left to rot for the centuries, the dwarven miners had implanted in
each machine the brain and spinal column of a domesticated kobold so as to
make them controllable. Many of the Podrikev retained the beasts' instinct of
survival and attempted to explore beyond the mines in search of continued
existence. In time, their intelligence evolved and adapted itself to the
surrounding environments. 
{x   The Podrikev are very large, very bulky, mechanical beasts that are
fashioned from plates of steel, bronze, iron, and granite. All Podrikev run on
a system of pullies, levers, grinders, chains, and other contraptions
including dry batteries and a fuel converter for changing food into energy.   
{x  All of the Podrikev walk with an audible clank and expell a
nauseating exhaust. They are hardy and when well-oiled become formidable
opponents in battle.
{x   Podrikev have the affect of sight of invisible, hidden and are able to
see creatures in the dark. Magic, Cold or Poison does not affect them but
and sometimes Disease and fire. They are though affected by water and wood.
These fine creatures make a good warrior.

Satyr Satyrs~
Also called fauns, satyrs are a pleasure loving race of half-human, half-goat
creatures.  They symbolize nature's carefree ways.  Satyrs have the torso,
head, and arms of a man, and the hind legs of a goat.  The human head is
surmounted by two sharp horns that poke through the satyr's coarse, curly
hair.  The skin of the upper body ranges from tan to light brown, with rare
individuals (1%) with red skin.  A satyr's hair is medium reddish, or dark
brown.  The horns and hooves are black.  Satyrs living near centaurs are
likely to be friendly with them.

0 race_titan~
Titan Titans~
Titans are dark-skinned humanoids, similar in appearance to the average human,
though most often much taller and larger in body mass.  Their height varies
greatly from a little over 5 feet, to some of the elder titans towering at over
15 feet in height when standing.  It is rumored that titan height signifies and
is influenced by their social status, though in modern times, it is rare to
encounter a titan who stands much taller than 8 feet.  Titans traditionally wear
loose fitting clothes of earthen colors, tunics and loincloths made of simple
materials. Jewelry and elaborate decoration is common among this race, but is
less of a symbol of wealth than it is something of beauty that titans admire.
{x
The details of the titan exodous to the Great Realms is largely unknown due to
the introverted nature of titan society.  What is know is that millenia ago, a
small group of titans ventured from the outside realms into what we now know as
the Great Realms and settled the valley east of the central mountain range, in
the area now known as Titan Valley.  There, the titan society flourished, though
isolated from much of the realms, until the gradual opening of trade with nearby
races introduced the Great Realm titans to the general public. Titan culture is
rich in tradition, though there is still much that is unknown to modern scholars
about the day to day workings of titan society despite the openness to outsiders
that the race has shown in latter days.

Racial-Traits~
There are many traits and passive abilities among
the many different races in the great realms. Since
each race is unique in five disinct area, a diverse
band of adventurers can be found. The five abilities
and traits are: Size, Resistance, Vulnerability,
Immunity, and Permanent Affects. 
{x
Size: Although mostly pertaining to the ability of
a gladiator to slam into their opponent, the size
of a player is determined by their race. The size
of the races in the great realms ranges from: Tiny,
Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Giant in that order. 
Resistance: Due to a natural ability to diminish
the effect of an attack, some races have found ways
to become resistant to certain types of damage. Being
resistant to a type of attack greatly reduces the
damage these attacks will generate. The ability to
resist: Lightning, Cold, Fire, Holy, Light, Weapons,
Slash, Pierce, Bash, Poison, Disease, Charm, Energy,
Magic, Negative, and Acid are inherent in certain
creatures. 
{x
Vulnerability: No race is without weakness but some
races have vulnerabilities that leave them open to
devastating attacks. These vulnerabilities can range
from relatively harmless to being lethal in certain
circumstances. Each races vulnerabilities are different
but can be: Holy, Light, Drowning, Slash, Magic, 
Bash, Cold, Pierce, Lightning, Weapon, Negative,
Disease and Poison. 
{x
Immunities: Weathering such torments as the realms
can muster some races have found the ability to be
completely immune to certain attacks. These Immunites
cause them to be completely unharmed by those attacks
and spells of an immune type will never land. Only
ability to be completely immune to: Disease, Poison,
Fire, Charm, Negative are available and to just a
few creatures. 
{x
Permanent Effects: Some creatures have, due to their
race, an ability that is always with them. The winged
creatures of the realms obviously are always able
to fly and thus have this as a permanent part of
them. The racial talents that are able to be permanent
effects are: Detect hiddden, Detect Invis, Detect
Good, Detect Evil, Detect Magic, Fly, Farsight, Infrared, 
Regeneration, Dark Vision, Haste, Sneak, Pass Door,
Swim, Berserk,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{x
  The continent of Cruoris is divided into multiple countries and several
territories.  In early history most of these countries were formed solely by
single races, but over time and mixture of the races these traditions of old
have all but faded away for most.
{x
  There are two major types of governments found in Cruoris, Kingdoms and
Empires.  Both follow the same general ideas, such as both are ruled by a
single family with the power of rulership passed down through the generations,
or until the people uprise and murder the bloodline.
{x
  Kingdoms are ruled by Kings who make judgements on matters of their country
with the opinions of an advisory counsel elected by the people.  Empires are
ruled by Emperors who do not need to have an advisory counsel, though they may
choose to create one of their own people.
{x
  City-States are concidered small countries, unlike Kingdoms and Empires which
are made up of multiple large settlements, a City-State typically is the rule
over a single town and or hamlets with little land.  These types of governments
are found mostly in territories, though there are some exceptions (Makou City).
{x
  Below is a short list of the major governments, see their indepth help file
for more details.

|                          Roleplayer Flag                          | 11/13/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  WaterdeepMUD is classified as Roleplay Encouraged, meaning that to roleplay
here is a choice.  There are several rules that -all- players must follow which
allows us to retain a certain feel in the RP world, but in the end it is the
choice of each player if they wish to take part in the activities of role
playing.
{x
  The Roleplayer Flag is an option which is turned on by those who wish to
roleplay here on WD.  Turning this flag on will display the R flag in the
who list and will place your name under the WHO RP option.  It tells other
players that you are a roleplayer.  It will also allow you to use our IC or
'In Character' channels which are not accessable without the flag, details can
be found in HELP CHANNELS.
{x
  Do -NOT- turn this flag on just to access the IC channels or to just gain the
R flag on the who list.  We have imposed the harsh rule of removing people from
the game for such acts, to keep people from abusing our rp encouraged world.
{x
[ Requirements - What You Need To Do ]
 ------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------
{x
  1.  You are required to have a character description of at least 255 letters.
  Descriptions with ascii graphics are allowed within roleplaying reasons, and
  the description itself is to be of RP nature.  Filling a description with
  non-rp text is a no, and so is full ascii graphics with no other text.  Cases
  will be judged case by case.
{x
  2.  You are also to fill out your TRAIT information which is displayed in the
  character information found in the FINGER <Name> command.  See HELP TRAIT for
  details on using the command.
{x
[ RP Config Options ]
 ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
{x
  There are two CONFIG options related to the roleplayer flag.
{x
  - CONFIG ROLEPLAYER allows you to toggle the RP flag off and on.  This allows
  you to turn the flag off when you are not roleplaying, thus alerting people
  that you are not actively doing so.
{x
  - CONFIG CHANNELS allows you to turn off the OOC channels, thus tuning out
  the non-roleplayers of the game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Besides the rule stated above about turning the RP flag on when you have no
intention on roleplaying and or just want the IC channels, you must keep your
description up after turning the flag on.  Besides immortals checking people at
random, the mud will automatically RP-Ban you upon logging in without a
description of less than 255 letters.  You can rewrite your description and
then contact an staff member to have the ban lifted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{x
  Magical Energy can be found and used in several various ways, natural magic
being the most common.  Natural Magic is the ability of all living creatures
to harness their magical energy and use it in various ways.  Alchemist magic
is the ability to use magical powers to manipulate and change the chemical
form of an object, creating a new object in the process.  There are also two
types of crystals found on the planet which contain magical properties, the
more common Materia found deep in caves, and Magicite which is formed from
the remains of the esper race.
{x
  Below you will find the sub-help files to each type of magic, which gives
full details on how the magic works, and is used.
{x

[ Types of Magic ]

 HELP RP-Magic-Natural   : The magic found in all living creatures.
      RP-Magic-Alchemist : Altering the chemical compounds of items via magic.
      RP-Magic-Magicite  : A type of magical crystal created from espers.
      RP-Magic-Materia   : Cystalized Lifestream found deep in the earth.

|                          Alchemist Magic                          | 10/25/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Alchemist Magic is the magical practise of changing the chemical compounds of
objects and materials.  It is not a highly practised form of magic in the
realms due to its heavy influences by scientific study, which is generally
frowned upon by magical users.  The reforming of the chemical compounds of an
object is done by natural magic abilities, the same as if casting a spell.
{x
  In short the ability of alchemist magic allows the user to take a pile of
iron shrapnel and reform it into a metal sword or piece of armor.  Math plays
a heavy part, as 5 pounds of iron cannot be transformed into a 10 pound sword.
It could only create a 5 pound sword.  A secondary practise is the general use
of shape reformation.  Heavy Iron Gauntlets can reform into Metal Gloves or
thinner full arm length armor.  A fat dagger can transform into a thin long
sword.
{x
  Alchemist Magic requires indepth training and can take decades to fully
harness, another reason why it is a lesser practise magic.

|                         Magicite Crystals                         | 10/25/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Magicite Crystals are created from the mortal remains of the esper race.
Over the course of roughly 100 years their bodies decompose into a solid
crystal which contains a high amount of magical energy and knowledge.  In very
rare practise, a magical user who made physical contact with the magicite was
able to unlock the esper's knowledge of magic, allowing them to cast once
unknown spells and gain additional magical abilities.  This method is only
available to the extremely well trained magical user.  This practise is very
rare due to the fact that Magicite is the remains of dead espers, and the
diffilculting in tapping the crystal's power.
{x
  The Vectorian Empire has put magicite crystals to use in their Magitek Armor
Units, giant mechanical machines which are powered directly by the crystal,
and can harness, tap and unlock the magical power of the crystal in the form
of spells.  Since it is the machine that is tapping and casting the power of
the crystals, it allows the common soldier who ride and control the machine
to cast powerful magical spells.
{x
  Fake Magicite does exist, and is another product of the Vectorian Empire.
This is the forced process of forming a magicite like crystal, which is in
fact a liquid stored inside a glass vial.  This fake magicite along with
the Magitek Armor Units are created inside Vector City's Magitek Factory.
The process in which fake magicite is created is the liquification of esper
remains.  This method creatures a much weaker magicite, but the process
takes a matter of weeks rather than a century.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Materia Magic is the use of materia crystals as a magical source.  Materia
is a solid form of the lifestream found deep inside caves and comes in several
varieties.
{x
  Green Materia is the most common and is generic in nature, with various
enchantments these crystals can hold magical spells which can allow someone
without good magical ability to cast powerful spells.  Due to this nature, the
use of green materia for this purpose is forbidden by the general population. 
Other uses have been put forth, such as enchantments which teleport sound and
sight to other crystals.
{x
   Purple Materia has the natural ability to enhance the abilities of a person
near it, especially if worn touching the skin.  These enhancements can include
extra strength, wisdom, constitution, etc or a boost in physical power (hp)
and magical power (mana), while also create higher resistances to attacks.
{x
   Yellow Materia much like purple will naturally give its user a magical
spell or ability that they did not previously have.  Unlike Purple Materia,
the yellow materia must be touching the skin for this reaction to take place.
Yellow materia is created by the knowledge of the lifestream and all those who
have joined it in death.
{x
   Red Materia is said not to exist.  Legend and lore dictates that red
materia are the souls of powerful creatures that have passed.  If used the
person holding it can summon and control the spirit of the creature inside.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In recent times it has come to the understanding of scholars and researchers
that the source of all natural magic is a band of energy found deep inside the
planet, dubbed The Lifestream.  Theories explain that the Lifestream is spirit
energy of all living creatures, who are born from this stream and return to it
upon death.  This belief is backed up by the fact that all living creatures
are capable of using natural magic, though their powers will vary.
{x
  How magical energy is used depends on the intelligence of the creature which
is using it.  Creatures of lower intelligence tend to use magic in an
uncontrolled nature, and used more as an instinctive defense.  Creatures of
higher intelligence will use magic in the form of spells and incantations
which fall into four spheres, Offensive, Defensive, Creationism and
Transportation.
{x
  From the various studies of magic, it has also been noted that despite the
fact all living creatures can use magic, the level of use various from
creature to creature.  In general most creatures are unable to actually
harness their magical abilities, while at the opposite end certain creatures
can have a high talent for using it.  In the higher intelligence creatures,
these talented people tend to become magical users such as mages, wizards,
priests and clerics.
{x
  The connection between the Lifestream and Magical Powers was discovered
during an historic event on the western side of the Cruoris Continent.  There
was an actual draught of the lifestream under the Figaro Kingdom.  This first
caused plant life to die off, followed by the weakening and eventually
disappearance of magical users abilities to use their magic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Technology is very advanced on the continent of Cruoris compared to the rest
of Toril, especially its sister continent in the east, Faerun.  These
technologies have influenced the shape and culture that is Cruoris, and are
rarely found outside of the continent.  There are four main branches of
technology found.
{x

[ Technology Branches ]
 --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
 HELP Technology-Water : The oldest of techs, harnessing water for power.
      Technology-Clock : The use of gears and springs to drive a machine.
      Technology-Steam : Machines powered by water steam and fueled with coal.
      Technology-Makou : A multipurpose fuel that replaced steam and more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Clock technology is the second oldest technology found on the continent of
Cruoris, and in general is the creation of machines which run on various gear
and gear ratios (size).  Its most used application of course is the time
keeping clock, the earliest of clock inventions.  This technology was invented
on the western coast by the humans of the Figaro Kingdom and widely used in
their country.
{x
  Besides clocks themselves, various inventions were created which used clock
technology, ranging from small mechanically driven toys for children to large
wagons and carts which moved under their own power, and not that of an animal.
The technology would be sold to the elves of Blue Haven and the dwarves of
Deva who combined the use of gears with their water technology, creating more
efficent and larger water wheel powered mills.  When industry began to boom
in the realms, its application was put towards the machines that would
populate these new factories.
{x
  Before the invention of steam power, the original factories of the
industrial boom were either powered by water wheels or giant springs which
like clocks, had to be wound so often.  Of course in certain regions, power
was generated by workers who would do the work of a spring and turn the
mighty gears of the factory.  Steam power would replace any method of power
beyond itself, and also allow machines to be smaller in size due to less
gears.

|                        Technology:  Water                         | 10/25/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Water Technology is the oldest of all technologies in Cruoris, said to be
developed by the elvish kingdom of Blue Haven.  The first invention was the
water wheel, used to power grinding stones in mills.  These water wheels would
also power other water related inventions.  Over time knowledge was gained on
the use of water pressure to power larger machines, improving the elven mills.
The water pump allowed water to be transported through pipes into cities and
used for irragation purposes in farming.
{x
  These major steps in farm and milling would soon spark the evolution of
trade in Cruoris.  It was said the first major trade and business conducted
was between the elves of Blue Haven and the dwarves of Deva, who traded their
ores in exchange for water pumps, which would be used in their ore mining
operations and forging process.
{x
  It can be said that this technology is the most common in the realms, as most
cities have piped water under their streets and in most of their homes.  Before
the human race gained this technology, it was kept very natural.  For example
the dwarves and elves would build their water wheel powered mills in natural
rapid waters, where as the humans would construct dams and force the power from
the river.

|           The Continent of Cruoris + "The Great Realms"           | 10/05/09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
   Cruoris is located in the southeastern portion of the Toril Map and has a
 very round shape.  Its central region are high peak mountains which also form
 a circular pattern, with a round valley in the center and helps divide the
 continent into various regions.
   The eastern coast of the continent is home to most of the gameboard zones
 found on the mud.  The middle region is split in half by the Reaper Scythe
 Mountains, a thin chain of mountains which reaches out from the central high
 peaks.  Most of its northern half is ruled by the Vectorian Empire until its
 meets the snow of the frozen north. The southern half is ruled by the
 Tripower Kingdom, while its southern extreme is nothing but wilderness, once
 the Kingdom of Doma.
 
   The northern coastline is a cold region.  Before the snowline of the frozen
 north lies various territories and small countries that are usually only
 several townships and farmlands.  The Frozen North known as Mahn'Tor is
 nothing but snow and ice, with only one major city and several small villages.
 The northwestern region is another mountainous region seperate from the
 Central Peaks of the continent.  It is ruled by the Deva Kingdom and its
 mountains are rich with metal ore.
 
   The western coastline south of the Deva Kingdom region is desert wastelands,
 ruled by the Kingdom of Figaro.  These lands several centuries ago had been
 lush farm grasslands which dried up, turning the region into a harsh desert.
 East of the Figaro Desert are small forests and grasslands before meeting the
 Central Peaks.  South of Figaro is the Haven Kingdom, a land full of rivers,
 small lakes, forests and grasslands.
 
   The southern coastline is void of any large empire and features an untouched
 wilderness with several small countries placed within.
 
   Unlike Faerun, more advanced technology can be found on Cruoris, that based
 on the steampunk world of Final Fantasy 6.  For more information see
 Help RP-Technology and Help RP-Theme.

Blind opponents are dead opponents. Based on this premise, theives
developed the under-handed skill of gouge. Quickly reversing their
weapon, the thief uses the hilt of their weapoon to deliver a painful
poke to the eyes of their opponent. The pain goes away after a short 
time (1 tick) and sight returns, but sometimes, that moment is enough. 
This blindness can not be cured with the 'Cure Blindness' spell.

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although some other classes may learn it as well.

generally turn a foe's body against itself.  As the priests which initially

Healing~
Healing is a power which restores vitality by channeling the blessings of 
the gods or the caster's own internal energies into a wounded being.  Those
who wield this power must have extensive knowledge of how the body works in
order to best know how to direct the energy flow to where it is needed.
The Healing group consists of the following spells:
{x

cure light      loosely knits wounds, and returns a minor amount of energy

Illusion~
The art of deception can do much to lead opponents astray and gain an 
advantage in battle.  By manipulating the magical forces which surround
all things, the caster can dupe an enemy into seeing that which is
not real.  Illusionists must remain wary, however, for even the most
well-planned subterfuge may not hoodwink all foes.  The Illusion group
contains the following spells:
{x
decoy           (Thf/Mer) creates a perfect doppleganger of the caster
invis           manipulates light around the caster, making them unseen

Maladictions~
Beings of wicked intent may call upon the dark arts to invoke baneful 
curses which torture and inconvenience their foes.  These hexes do little 
actual damage to an enemy, but are instead designed to cripple, torture, 
and otherwise hinder the abilities of an opponent.  The following spells 
are contained within the Maladiction group:
{x
blindness      invokes a hex which strikes the target blind

0 spellgroup_protect~
Protective~
Being less able to rely upon the cumbersome constraints of heavy armor to 
shield them, the mages of the realms created the Protective spells to 
provide them with defense against harm.  These incantations will limit the 
amount of damage taken, whether inflicted by spell or weapon.  Those adept 
at the protectives can even learn how to strip spells from themselves and 
others.  The following spell are found in the Protective group:
{x

cancellation    a power-word which removes most enchantments from a person

0 spellgroup_shield~
Shielding~
By tapping into the primal energies of the planes, casters can envelop
themselves or others in the shielding of the elements.  These arcane powers
inflict damage upon any being which dares to attack the person encircelled
by the shielding; raking the offender with freezing blasts of ice, scorching
bolts of electricity, and burning gouts of flame.  The Shielding group
consists of the following spells:
{x
iceshield       envelops target in freezing shell of ice 
fireshield      surrounds target with a flaming inferno
shockshield     encircles target with a crackling sphere

Transportation~
Spellusers, being a largely lazy bunch of arcane-studying bookworms, will
do anything to get out the most mundane of tasks, especially having to 
walk to a destination.  Through the use of sorcery or prayer, a caster
may draw upon magic to transport themselves, another being, and even objects
to another place.  The Transportation group contains the following spells:

The whims of nature have long fascinated the denizens of the realms, for
