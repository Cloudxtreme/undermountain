Two guards mill about, calm within the furious storm, as if they were
used to such things.  Seeing you, they utter a short prayer to Talos,

{*A huge bath dominates this room.  In the center of the bath stands
an enormous obsidian statue.  The statue is of a broad-shouldered,
bearded young man with a single good eye, the other covered by a dark

smooth leather armor and gloves.  As you stand there in awe at the
statue you swear you hear a voice whisper "{BGo and destroy, my

{w    of the church. If possible, internal issues should be dealt

{w     #      Fighter                    Spellcaster
{w     0      Soldier                    Battlemage

{*    7.5 {wranks 0-3 can be given to any member by leaders at any 
{w    given time. For demoting a member, a majority of leaders has
{w    to agree.
 
{*    7.6 {wRanks 0-3 have no special rights and rank cannot be used to
{w    command lower ranks. Ranks are character based and not player
{w    based. If one of your characters receives a rank this does not
{w    mean that your alts will receive an equivalent rank.
 
{*    7.7 {wRanks will be displayed in a bracket and every member will
{w    have a rank. If the member already has a bracket or later wants
{w    to change it to a custom bracket, they are required to have 
{w    their rank somewhere in their description.
