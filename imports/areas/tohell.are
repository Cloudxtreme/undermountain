A {Rm{wa{Rn{8ia{Rc{wa{Rl {cs{gu{wr{Bg{we{go{cn {xis eagerly waiting for his next opportunity to use his scalpel.
~
A mad glint in this surgeon's eye  gives the impression  that his help
might do  more harm than  good.  His long white  smock and  gloves are
quite liberally spattered with blood.  Smears  of blood cover his face
since he chooses not  to wear a mask while he performs his tasks.  The
bloody scalpel he  holds is not a particularly vicious weapon but each
precise cut of  that tiny blade  could bring about  unimaginable pain.

Nearly twice the size of the drone males who protect her this gigantic
wasp is a particularly fierce opponent when confronted in her hive.  A
huge set  of long thin pinchers adorn her massive head.  The tusk like
structures are strong as steel and long enough to kill a swordsman and
still stay far out of reach of  his weapon.  However, the massive jaws
of this queen are a pleasantry compared to its poisonous sting.  While
the sting does not kill  its victim it paralyzes the victim and leaves
them in a conscious state of immobility.  She  then injects  eggs into
the victims body.  Once the larvae hatch they eat their way out of the
paralyzed being  ending in a horribly painful death that takes days to
reach its culmination.

hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!

that I was tormented to witness. The bodies of the sinful
lie scattered amidst a field of burning sands.  Blood pours
from their eyes in sorrow, as they have no more tears left
to shed.  They cannot move, as hellish manes have eaten

Huge wooden  crates are all about the room.  Some  loaded onto carts
while others still  await their departure  on the shipping room floor.
Each of the crates  has a shipping  stamp on its side indicating where
the device inside is to be sent.  Workers move about carefully packing
the precious machines into crates  for shipping to their new owners. A
particularly large  crate with a large  brightly colored label catches
your eye.  A steady  procession of screams issues forth from the north
while the occasional  explosion rattles the  loose objects in the room
and issues forth a bone rattling boom from the east.

The massive wooden crate which the workers handle with the utmost care
and respect  has a huge bright  yellow label taking  up nearly half of
each side of the box the label reads:

You can only imagine what horror Nisstyre has personally requested of
the builders.  However, it would probably be best to stay on his good
side so as not to find out.

This impressive chamber houses a  plethora of pain inducing devices.
Each device is  continuously running to make certain  that at the most
crucial moment  of torture  the machine will not  fail to complete its
task.  A strange group of participants in the stress testing locked in
large iron cages near  the center of the  chamber.  These poor  beings
appear as though they have been pieced together from body  parts of an
assortment of different  people and races.  Apparently  body parts are
in no short order from  the large bloody carts that  rest next to many
of the devices to aid in the removal of the many dead and dismembered.

remove various parts of  the machines and transport  them to the large
scrapyard to be reused in new  inventions.  A vast junkyard  like area
with constant  sounds of metal on  metal and the occasional explosion.

This chamber seems to be a focal point for the general area.  The vast
chamber is dominated by a lake of  bright green acid.  The pool gently
laps against  the narrow pathway that  follows its  perimeter the acid
bubbling  and spitting  from  time to  time.  Four  statues  of deadly
venomous serpents feed the lake with green jets pouring forth from the
sabre-like  fangs of the  serpents.  The  pathway which  appears to be

The long curving tunnel seems to be a popular place.  Massive sickly
ogreish  hulks drag  live victims down the  narrow walkway towards the
source of the noxious fumes that waft down this corridor.  More of the
acid splattered brutes drag armloads of  lifeless bodies away from the
source of the fumes.  At  more or less fixed  intervals the screams of
the victims comes to a  horrifying crescendo then a death-like silence
follows.  Shortly after a row of brutes  with arms full of  lost souls
makes its way back away from the southern end of the tunnel.

Scattered  about the room  are long retro orange  and green  leather
benches.  The deafening  cries of  sickly children make the  ear drums
throb, while the amount of disease causing agents floating through the
stagnant air is enough to lay low even the healthiest  individual.  As
direly wounded individuals wait an eternity to see  the overpriced and
generally incompetent doctors their moans of pain mix with the yelling
of the out of control children to create a heart  wrenching display of
audible pain.  A single door of hope  lies at the far end of the room.
However, it will most likely never open for these poor souls.

The long white hallway stretches  off to the east.  The ominous feel
of the dead and dying  lingers heavily here.  The chill  in the air of
the building  lends  to the feeling that this  is much more a place of
dying than a place of healing.

Easily wide enough to allow four or five people to walk side by side
this vast  hallway is for the most part unused.  Occasionally  a nurse
will busle by going about  her tasks or a patient is  brought into the
operating  theater, aside from those  few there is no  one about.  The
monotony  of the  hall is maddening nothing breaks  up the long, white
corridor.  The only  sound are the  echoing sobs and screams  from the
waiting  room and  the muffled  cries of pain from the surgeon's work.

Obviously the abode  of some  purely evil and malevolent  being this
large chamber is filled with  echoing screams of pain.  Huge vats of a
bubbling green liquid  release  whisps of  noxious fumes that burn the
eyes and nose.  The green  glow of  the acid bathes the chamber with a
sickly aura.   Large, disfigured  brutes chain  helpless  victims to a
series  of wenches.  The thugs are so hideously  scarred by  the acid,
that it is next to impossible to ascertain who or what they once were.
Still more of  the  tormentors are  turning large cranks which  slowly
lower the  victims feet  first  into the vats.  A large dais is at the
center of it all its  raised elevation giving anyone who resides there
a perfect view of all the happenings at the vats.  Atop the dais rests
a horrifying throne  created from  countless skeletons  that have been
completely stripped of flesh and polished to a sickly shine.

A towering stone portcullis heavily decorated in carvings of various
acts of torture involving stinging poison and acids blocks any further
passage to the west.  The center of the giant  doorway is covered in a
carving of a  once beautiful angel screaming in  agony as  her face is
melted away and her once legendary wings are reduced to  useless stubs
of bone.  So lifelike is the image that a faint scream of purest agony
can be  heard coming  from  the gaping mouth  of the angel.  To either
side  of the  portcullis are  thick iron  bars  giving a  view of  the
hideous figures bound for all eternity to serve their master.  To your
horror you realize the gigantic  brutes have no  hands.  Instead their
hands have  been removed  and their thick forearms have  been fixed to
the handle of the cranks which operate the portcullis.

The sound  of the splashing from  the lake to  the north  are nearly
drowned out  by the hopeless sobs of the occupants of this  room.  All
about the room people who seem to have  sprouted excess limbs and body
parts moan  and sob in despair at the horror which is now  their wreck
of a  deformed body.  An  exceptionally bright pillar of  some glowing
stone bathes  the room and  everything in it with a  radioactive green
glow.  While  there is  nothing  stopping  the victims  of the  stones
deforming radiation  they seem to  be too horrified by what  they have
become to flee from this eternal torment.

A horrifying stench greets all who approach this room.  The odor has
such a  potent stench  that it  muddles the mind  and makes  those who
inhale  it choke  and become dizzy. Huge ogre  like figures with  skin
ranging  from a sickly green  to a mucky brown are all around the room
going about their  gruesome tasks.  Some drag victims ,who  scream and
claw  against the inhuman strength of  their  captors, to large  glass
enclosures  and crank  the hatch shut  trapping  the powerless  souls.
Still more of the creatures bustle  about connecting  long hoses which
breathe forth noxious clouds of poisonous gases to the air tight tanks
full of victims.  As each hose  is connected those  trapped inside try
not to breath but when the supply of clean air in their lungs runs out
they are forced to gasp the killing  fumes.  The poor helpless victims
twitch and gag until finally they move no more.  After the last of the
captives seizes to move the hose is  disconnected the hatch opened and
the dead bodies tossed into huge piles as if they were merely garbage.
