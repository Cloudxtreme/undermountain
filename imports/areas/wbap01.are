Who We Are
------
We are a self-paid organization that fights the crime within
the cities. We work as a police force, from captains to sargents.
We create Contracts with the mayors of willing cities and towns,
that allow us to make our own laws, which follow along the lines
of the cities laws.
{x
------
Our Purpose
------
We wish to see the "Old Law" enforced in the cities of the realms.
These are the laws written from past governments, those that excisted
before the TriPower. We keep order on the streets, and remove the
one with marks on there heads (Wanteds).
~

Page 2
------
The Rules
------
1. We will take applications at 1st Tier level 40, and anytime 2nd tier.
2. We work applications through your ways of roleplaying & pkilling.
3. Respect and order is a major part of the clan.
4. Members will respect each other in order of the ranks.
5. The X-Cops System is to be followed, along with RP.
{x
------
The Roleplaying
------
The X-Cops is like real life police. Always looking for law breakers,
harrasing people, the things you see on "Cops", we act like police
officers, but we also act within the realms, as in we don't have guns,
or patrol cars. We do have swords, and patrol horses.

You stand in front of 317 Coffin Street, Westbridge.  The once
great X-Cops Station House use to stand in this lot, until the guild
was closed down and destroyed.  The building is gone, but now stands a
large hangar type building, used for the construction and storage of
airships, owned by Judge Incorperated.  A large iron fence surrounds
the entire lot, which sticks into the bad neighborhood of Westbridge. 
The gates in the fence are to the east.

Back Hallway~
~
This is the back hallway, which isn't very long.  You walk into a
good size room, just not big enough for a room, but not small enough
for a hallway.  Three doors stand before you, to the north, east and
south.  The door to the north has a white glass window in it, and
black letters on the front read "Pilot's Lounge".  To the south
another door with white glass stands, it's black letters reading
"Meeting Room".  The door to the east is the Port Master's Office, the
main guy in charge of the hangar and port itself.

bookcase filled with things to read, a small fireplace in one corner
and windows look out over the scrap yard, and northern Westbridge.  A
magical sphere sits in the corner, glowing white with energy, also
seen on airships.  An old punk wizard sits next to it smoking a pipe,
and casting a few spells.
