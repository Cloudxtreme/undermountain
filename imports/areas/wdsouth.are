{wA short, {Mplump {gg{yn{gome{w stands here, sometimes selling things, sometimes not.{x
~
He's average height for a gnome, though a little plump. He wears all
manner of gadgetry about him, cementing the idea that he is a tinker
much like many other gnomes in these realms. He doesn't have a large
selection of goods like the other vendors, but rather only a select few
items which he rotates on a daily basis both to stimulate demand for
his unique goods, as well as to offset dwindling supplies. He has a reputation
for offering some very nice items fit for adventuring.

{8Perpetually watching, this gargoyle head has been carved with eyes
closed, inset atop the gates of this tower which rises high above.  An
occasional trickle of dust falls from its face, but otherwise its
features are still, void, and in a way it instills fear in those who
look upon it.  Locals who pass by do so with their eyes casted away
from this grotesque face, for something strange lies behind those
stone eyelids...  Something strange lies within this tower.  {x

A short, bald human stands on a stool, organizing the shop.

He is exceptionally short for a human, just a little tall for a
halfling.  He looks to be middle aged, he is bald and skinny.  He
wears an old moneylender's suit, complete with coinbelt and a monocle
that dangles from his shirt pocket.  He seems full of energy, spending
his time trying to organize his cluttered shop, though by the looks of
things, he is failing miserably.

This is a member of Waterdeep's city watch--the policing force of
the city.  This watch member wears the official uniform of the City
Watch: a doublet of leather armor studded with iron rings beneath a
green, black and gold overcoat that bears the city crest.  A
three-quarters helm prevents you from readily telling whether this is
a man or woman, but make no mistake, the watch is armed and is in
official capacity to use full force when necessary to uphold peace in
the city.

Just off Waterdeep Way is the open square directly in front of the
government complex of the city, known traditionally as Piergeiron's
Palace, as named because it still serves as a residence for
Piergeiron--Waterdeep's first Lord.  The commons are heavily patrolled
by the city watch and guard, who both share in the duties here.  The
palace grounds are set behind tall iron gates, guarded continuously
and access inside is strictly prohibited.  Just behind the palace
rises Mount Waterdeep and beyond it the Sea of Swords.

A narrow gate is set just off the Street of Silk, leading up a
steep set of stairs to an path of onyx, and beyond it a jet black
tower of modest size.  The gate is decorated with blooming flowers and
remains unlatched, seemingly a welcoming gesture for those wishing to
journey to the tower.  Little is known about the tower at the end of
this pathway, but for certain there are many who pass by without so
much as a glance.  The uneasyness in their eyes is unmistakable.

This wide intersection is the main crossing point of the two most
heavily used roads in all Waterdeep. To the north runs the famous
High Road, leading through some of the city's most visited sights.
To the west begins the Way of the Dragon, connecting the far west
part of the city. Of note here is a large signpost, floating with
no supports in the air.  Upon it is tacked arrows pointing in all
directions, indicating some of the most popular sites in the city.

Continuing its long run laterally through Waterdeep the High Road rises
gently upward as it ventures north along the eastern sloping reaches of
Mount Waterdeep, which can be easily seen towering to the northwest. An
incredible view of this road can be witnessed here looking northward as
it rises. A sea of people, carts and animals runs along its length, all
the way to the point where it levels off at the top of the plateau. The
sides of the road are staggered with storefront displays, street vendor
carts and broadsheet criers who operate on foot.  While much of traffic
continues down two streams, north and south, there are places where the
flow is interrupted either by an interesting site, or by merging crowds
in from an intersecting street. Not far south of here is Waymoot square.

The crowd dispurses here in a torrent of confusion as two large streets
intersect. Going north south is the High Road which is the direction of
most of the traffic. Cutting through it east west is Coach Street which
is where fast moving coaches either merge into the High Road, or atempt
to cut through it. In either scenario, the lack of an enforced right of
way makes the scene rather chaotic. Several prominent buildings rise up
here at the corners, though it is unclear what purpose they serve. Rich
architecure accents each, with intricately detailed stonework that sets
a sharp contrast with the buildings along all directions away from them,
those being best described as plain but functional. To the east one can
see the River Gate entrance while the west leads to the harbor district.
North along the High Road continues deeper into Waterdeep and the south
ventures to the famed Waymoot square, and eventually to the South Gates.{x

The crowds of people which travel this road are amazing for one who has
not been to a major city, and noteworthy for those who have.  Waterdeep
is the top of big cities, and though bigger crowds can be had elsewhere,
few other places can claim it a daily happening. Countless rows of tall
buildings can be found lining the roadway here taking on a plain square
look with shops operating out of lower levels and tenants living in the
higher floors. Here in the south ward one will find mostly local places
which cater to travelers along the main road. The Waterdhavians who are
caretakers to these businesses are friendly folk, though often too busy
to strike up extended conversation. For visitors to the city, along the
road is where much of the excitement can be found, as anything which is
marketable is here, and a hot meal and a cold drink is just up the road.

The road continues north and south, cutting through several residential
districts here in the south ward. The fast moving wagons and horses add
to the precariousness of traveling this route which serves double roles
as a connecting route for Waterdhavians in their daily routine and as a
major trade road connecting cities all over the Sword Coast.  There are
several inns, taverns and shops to be seen here and while discounts are
not their defining characteristic, good service and wide selections are.
For those seeking convenience, their path need not stray from this road,
as everything can be found alongside it.  Not far to the east stretches
the eastern Trollwall, a reminder of the haven this city serves for all

The poor looking buildings in this ward of the city suggest this is one
of Waterdeep's low income districts, though the locals here appear much
friendlier than those found further north among the temples and villas.
The hustle and bustle of the High Road makes for an adventure in and of
itself, attracting many to its luster while driving away those who seek
a slower pace in their daily grind. The roadway is wide - allowing room
for four wagons side by side. The surface is worn, but even having been
fashioned from thick riverstone and dug deep into the ground. Along the
stretch of road are many shops and taverns where finding an interesting
bobble or a good drink is easy. To the east sits a small shop operating
from the floor level of an old building displaying woven items for sale.

An endless river of carts, wagons, animals and people flows up and down
the High Road all hours day and night.  The banks of this river are the
countless rows of multi-storied buildings, here they are plain squarish
structures with shops on the lower levels and residential apartments on
the uppers. Here in the south ward of Waterdeep are mostly local places
which cater to travelers along the main road. The Waterdhavians who are
caretakers to these businesses are friendly folk, though the same can't
be said about the owners, who oftentimes are nobles living in the north
and sea wards, far from any of the hustle and bustle of people. Here is
where all the action is where anything can be bought, sold or traded in
a moment's barter and where good food and friends are just up the road.

Along the course of the High Road one will encounter almost everyone of
note, from broadcryers to amateur magic entertainers and tricksters and
an abundance of local flavor. The lax rules of social interaction makes
for varied companies as drunks and nobles can be seen walking alongside
one another though rarely engaged in any interaction. The buildings are
short, simple squarish structures made of wood and stone and lacking in
any ornate details.  Here in the south ward of the city, most buildings
serve as shops on the lower levels and densely packed apartments on the
uppers.  Just about anything can be found along this road, from taverns
and inns, to food vendors and shops peddling the latest in exotic goods.
The High Road continues its north south cut through the city while just
to the east lies an arched door marked "Beware Guardian Monsters Within".

Waterdeep is a booming metropolis rivaled by few other cities in all of
Faerun and only by the technological city of Torregiano west across the
Sea of Swords. Here along its most prominent street, the full feel of a
densely populated city can be felt. The High Road is wide, greater than
four coaches across, yet scarcely is there place to walk it during peak
hours in the day.  Many people representing the majority of civil races
and of all walks of life can be encountered here at anytime making this
also an area where one can expand contacts and learn more about culture.
Waterdeep is traditional yet among the most tolerant cities anyone will
run across, having in place numerous laws banning racial discrimination,
and promoting religious tolerance to all but the most extreme religions.{x

appearance. Clothing hands from lines stretching across narrow alleyway
and from window to window, where many potted plants sit in the sunlight
hinting that the upper floors of these buildings are mainly residential.

The fast moving wagons and horses make foot travel precarious along the
High Road, which serves both as a major connect point for Waterdhavians
as well as an important trade route for caravans traveling from town to
town. While other roads run parallel to this one, the High Road remains
the heaviest used of all roads in the city. As such there are many inns,
taverns, and shops to be seen along its length, and while discounts are
not their defining characteristic, good service and wide selections are.
For those seeking convenience, their path need not stray from this road,
as everything can be found alongside it.  To the east, an inviting shop
displaying all manner of potent potables lies ready to serve the public.

The High Road passes through the South Ward which lies south of here as
a long stretch of mostly residential buildings.  This locale represents
much of the northern half of the citizens ward so named as the majority
of middle and lower class Waterdhavians reside here.  The neighborhoods
are bustling yet peaceful, fast paced yet inviting and perhaps the only
place in all of Waterdeep where this feeling can be had. Most buildings
here are wood and stone - the most common building material to be found
in Waterdeep though emphasis is placed here on functionality, resulting
in many plain squarish buildings standing one after another equidistant
from the street. Here along the High Road, there is much to see ranging
from the many shops and services, to the locals in their daily pursuits.{x

Diamond Street is a quaint stretch of road, snaking through the
heart of the temple district.  Its namesake has been secured through
clever architectural references to diamonds in many forms, including
the diamond cut and beveled paving stones and stone walls which repeat
a diamond pattern motif.  The temples are dense here, as each seems to
be trying to one up the other, biding for the attention of would be
worshippers to draw more power to their gods, and laden their donation
jars.  Still, few places elsewhere in the realms gives you more sight
and sound to take in for your platinum than here.

This grand sized tavern, once looking very extravagant, is now beat and
scarred into from the many days and nights of arguments and brawl fights
that have come and passed.  At the north end of the tavern is a large bar
counter that takes up half of the room.  The other half of this sections of
the tavern is filled numerous table seatings for groups of all sizes.  The
bar counter and tables seem to look pretty crummy - mostly scarred, pitted,
and stained from who knows what.  Overall though, this is a pretty bustling
tavern, but most of the action takes place down a set of stairs in the back
where the games and entertainment stage lie.

Here, three roads intersect though predominant among them runs the High
Road north and south. To the west runs a rather clean, inviting stretch
denoted as the Street of Smiths. Its surface is neatly paved and gleams
with a shine hardly made by accident. To the east is just the opposite:
a narrow dirt packed roadway, crowded with caravan traffic and the many
beasts of burden which come with the traders.  Unsurpassed by either is
the High Road with its thick, rugged stonework paving, artifically worn
with roughing marks as a courtesy to the carts and coaches who would in
their haste loose traction from the smooth weathering of stones beneath
a multitude of travelers and time.  Against this great road, few others
in Waterdeep can compare both in terms of its size and high use and the
attention spent in maintaning it as a prominent cut through of the city.

The road inclines gradually as it leads northward up the sloping fringe
of Mount Waterdeep towering near to the northwest. Here along the road
there are numerous shops offering everything from basic traveling needs
to exotic foods and customized services, all at competitive prices that
mark this part of many traveler's journey as a noteworthy stop on their
otherwise tedious routine. Here in particular operates a loud and rowdy
tavern just to the east, where many people group to get in. It seems a
plain building, with painted pane windows and a raised porchway, and in
need of renovation. A simple wooden sign hangs atop the entrance naming
this place as The Sword's Rest. The High Road continues north and south.{x

The High Road cuts through the heart of the Trades Ward of Waterdeep as
evident by the many caravaneers and carts which traverse this locale in
heavy numbers. This ward is represented by modestly sized buildings, of
simple brick, stone and wood. Most all businesses here harbor the sales
of goods and services, those along this High Road are especially flashy
for those who pass by. There is also several taverns and inns which can
be found in this district, most are competitively priced with the basic
accomidations and offer a haven from the rustle and bustle of city life.
To the east runs an old dirt packed road where the caravans come and go
in large numbers.  A placemarker brands this road as leading to Caravan
Court, where the caravan merchants gather to exchange goods and gossip.{x

This dirt packed road hardly seems fitting in this thriving
metropolis, yet it seems more appropriate down an isolated stretch of
farmland, be it not for the tall buildings and somewhat more developed
sidewalk areas that surround it.  Old and fresh hay lie mixed and
trodden along the road, to minimize the spread and odor of animal
manure.  This road is perpetually ran by horses and other draft
animals, pulling their loads to and from the great Caravan Court to
the east.  To the west is the High Road, which engulfs this small
stretch in another world of fast paced city life.

Caravan Court opens to the east and south here, though there's
nothing much impressive about it.  A haze of dust hangs over this dirt
packed court, amidst a sordid crowd of drovers, beasts, wagons and
debauchery.  Cursing is a common sound to be heard over the groan of
pack animals, the perpetual stench of the assorted beasts of burden
lingering in the air.  Tall buildings crown the court, their backs
turned to the many underhanded dealings that goes on here and within
the shroud of the open stables.  The city watch makes a presence here,
though it is uncertain whether they too are in on much of the
uncounted profits made here each moment.  The Court continues
southeastward, while Caravan Street runs to the west.

This open, packed dirt courtyard is a general assembling area for
caravans.  Many draft animals and caravan drivers rest here for short
breaks from the road.  Here, the road dead ends against the eastern
city wall.  You notice many people standing or lounging against the
wall, engaged in some sort of game.  This is the northeast corner of
the courtyard, which is a rather dark and dingy area where some
colorful characters congregate.  Caravan Court continues southwest

A wide walkway dips in front of a very lavish looking villa set
within one of the most prominent districts in all of Waterdeep City. 
The palace grounds are a stone's throw away from this three story
home, tall and slender as the confinements of expanding space will
allow.  Two elegant marble statues greet visitors at the gate
entrance, where a steep stairway leads up to a terraced front landing
where a garden grove grows.  The villa is a classic flat, boxlike
style, with bright, multicolored awnings covering numerous small
windows and thick, stylized molding trimming every eave and overhang. 
Several small gargoyles sit atop the roof, which juts out to a modest
incline, despite the heavy rainfall that comes with the seasons here. 
Though the decor is very inviting, the small but significant fact that
the villa gates remain closed and locked suggest this private
residence is not open to the public.

This Court is perhaps the least developed yard in all of Waterdeep.
The ground is simple packed dirt scattered in hay to soak up animal
droppings.  A few crooked posts stand staked in the ground seemingly
at random and used to tie up animals.  Deep ruts create complex
crossover patterns in the ground as business is all the talk amidst a
flurry of laughing and swearing.  And the smell here is unbearable by
most anyone who does not spend their days around draft animals.  The
eastern Trollwall runs along the eastern side of the court, while
buildings surround it on the other sides.  Two roads lead in and out
of here, one placed southwest, and the other northwest.

Caravan Court extends here to the northeast, across an open yard of
packed dirt and crowds of traders.  Among the crowds here are carts,
wagons, beasts of burden, and traders representing just about every
civilized race you can think of.  Long before the city council
officially recognized this Court, it was established as a meeting
place for caravans to discuss trade routes and exchange their goods
with one another to maximize their profits.  So rooted was this place
in their lifestyle, and so dependent was it on Waterdeep's economy,
that every attempt made to develop this land into something else
failed, be it by unyielding city officials, or the mysterious deaths
of the developers.  Caravan Court continues east and north from here. 
To the south runs the Caravan Street.

The tracks of horses and other draft animals stitch across the road
in elaborate patterns, heading west and north.  This dirt packed road
is poorly kept and heavily traveled, though few others than the
caravans choose to venture it, so priority in its maintenance remains
a low priority for the city council.  To the north, a wide open area
can be seen, as the smell of animals lingers about--the courtyard
where the caravans commune with one another.

This wide road is rather crude for most, though heavily traveled by
the thick stepping caravans of the city.  So traveled is this road,
that the city would rather have the caravans pack the dirt than bring
in masons to properly pave it in stone.  Dust rises as carts ride by,
and animal refuse litters the road, making it inhospitable for foot
travel.  The east opens up into a large courtyard, where many of the
caravans setup camp, and just to the west, the civil likes of the High
Road can be seen.

Deep ruts carve their way into the rounded corners where to the
east this street merges with the great tradeway known as the High
Road.  Lying just off the main courseway, the Street of Smiths is a
popular sidestep for travelers looking to find some of Waterdeep's
classiest constructs.  Locals will warn however, that money and class
status is a decisive factor in seeing one's shop here, and while they
don't argue that everyone here is skilled, they will contest that
sometimes the skill found here is in the direction of deception rather
than craft talent.  The Street of Smiths continues westward, while to
the east runs the High Road.

This east west street is an icon of stature in Waterdeep,
exhibiting beautifully cut stones for paving, and ornate buildings
crowned in elaborate decorations that seem like they were painted just
yesterday.  The buildings along both sides of the street are tall and
seemingly new, fabricated mostly of stone with lower levels serving as
businesses and upper levels as residential lofts.  An exceptionally
beautiful house is to the north, built upon a raised terrace and
walled in with ornate stone and wrought iron wall.  The black stones
of this house contrast sharply with the buildings around it.

{3You have entered a rather large, and spacey Tavern.  The place is
rather old looking, and well worn from daily use.  The floorboards creak,
The tavern bar is marked and signaturized by adventurers of the past.  The
tables are crowded and packed - as usual for this tavern.  The crowd is
rather loud though, and quite rambunctious as people toss around their mugs
of ale, and rough each other around with playful, but hard, punches to each
other.  Everyone, including the staff of the tavern, seems quite busy. 
Perhaps that is why the {!menu{3 is posted on the wall, and not handed to each

Several rows of open front shops spill out onto the wide sidewalks
as many of Waterdeep's prominent craftsmen show off their services and
goods.  Renoun for housing some of the most skilled craftsmen in the
region, the Street of Smiths district is about as high profile as a
working class neighborhood can get.  Not all are well regarded
however, as money will establish anyone here just as much, if not more
than skill will, and many skillful smiths decline to live here due to
its elitist status.  The street continues east and west.

Diamond Street opens up widely to the north to a vista of a vast
garden built about the square.  More round than square, the garden
houses many lush greenery and plenty of benches, lamps and color which
makes it inviting to the senses.  The buildings along either side of
the road diminish in height from two to one story, almost bowing in
patronage to the garden which stands just north of here.  To the west
stands an elegant temple, somewhat impractical but abounding in
beauty.

The name of this street is an obvious choice, as many metalworking
shops are setup along both sides of the street.  Though not
necessarily the best smiths in Waterdeep, these are the most
prominent, as established families in the trade, or high ranking in
the guild of metalworkers.  In either case, their trade boots a high
value, and their location here ensures them a stable clientele.  In
return for this prominent location within the City of Spendors, each
smith donates a percentage of their profits to maintaining the look
and feel of this avenue; a pleasant walk amidst one of Waterdeep's
oldest established neighborhoods.  To the north operates one of
Waterdeep's most famous places: the Yawning Portal Inn.

The street is elegantly paved with straight cleaved stones that
give off an alluring luster which makes the Street of Smiths something
of legend among Waterdhavens.  Maintained by contract from the guild
of thralls and street sweeps, this street is under special contract
which requires thrice monthly a thorough scrubdown of each stone,
followed by a coating of fresh, hot wax provided by the guild of
lamplighters.  While making the streets somewhat unstable, the
roughened texture masoned into the stones provides adequate traction
while maintaining the pleasant shine.

The street curves west and north as it meets with a large temple
complex directly in front.  A common occurrence in the Sea Ward: roads
that veer sharply about large buildings of which staked claim to the
location long before it was a fashionable place to walk.  The traffic
is moderate, but lacks the hustle and bustle of the trade roads,
taking on an almost leisurely quality.

The Way of the Dragon continues through south Waterdeep, passing
several interesting shops and sites along the way.  The Southern Ward
is renoun for its hospitality and no frills take on big city life. 
Much of Waterdeep's middle class resides in this ward, where wealth
comes second to merryment.  As such, one will find many bars and
entertainment venues here sure to keep a visiting adventurer
entertained.  The street is paved in carefully fitted stones, and is
well maintained by the city's guild of custodians.  To the south is a
leatherman shop.

The finely paved street known as the Way of the Dragon continues
through the Southern Ward.  Much of the residential buildings here are
small squats or multi-storied apartments where living conditions are
less than ideal.  Buildings are old, but well maintained by its
residence, as the commoners who dwell here do so with a sense of
pride.  The streets are filled with travelers, carts, coaches and in
many places children who sit and people watch.  Apartment windows are
adorned with many colorful plants that catch the rainwater from the
roof, and wet clothing that hangs during the sunny afternoons.  The
pace here is fast, but not without a sense of courtesy as people move
out of the way of oncoming traffic.  The street continues east and
west, while to the north is a shop open for business.

The street continues through the Southern Ward of Waterdeep,
passing by many multi-storied buildings which house people at the
upper floors and shops at the ground level.  Though modest in their
looks, the structures here are utilized to their fullest, with small
garden ledges built outside windows, ropes stretching across buildings
to hang clothes and send across messages to nearby neighbors, even
rooftop gardens built for the tenants to enjoy what little nature
remains among the city of stone.  Storefronts are decorated with
bright colors to attract people inside, though most shops here have
modest offerings.  To the north is a large store, seemingly empty.

The street curves here, going north and east.  The people who walk
by are varied in appearance, but most wear simple clothes and very
little in the way of jewelry or armament, signifying most as
commoners.  In fact, much of this place seems to be where the common
Waterdhaven resides, as evident by the plain buildings and densely
packed living spaces.  The street is nicely paved in thick stones well
worn by the heavy traffic.  As a main avenue of the city, the council
ensures that the Way of the Dragon paves a welcoming picture to the
city's coin laden visitors.

The street continues around a few larger buildings, meandering
gently as it cuts through the Southern Ward.  Just to the west, the
sounds of mooring bells can be heard, as large ships pull into the
largest harbor on the western coast.  The air is cool and crisp, with
a hint of a salty mist lingering.  The local Waterdhavens busy
themselves with all manner of distractions: sitting along the shaded
entrance to an apartment complex, or pruning a tiny garden within a
split barrel, and a few are too busy with their destinations to
consider much else but their stride.  The look of these buildings is
typical of a commoner class, as this Ward is known by few, but lived
in by many.

This street is finely paved in durable flat stones, most likely
pulled from the Dessarin.  They are cut and laid with care, having no
more than a finger's thickness between them.  Most are small stones,
no bigger than the size of an average human's head, and thus they
follow the contours of the road closely.  Heavy traffic has over the
years, upturned a few, which are periodically reset by the guild of
masons.  The Way of the Dragon cuts through several quaint shops and
residential buildings, all modest in style as this district is where
the commoners live.  To the north, a popular looking tavern is open
for business.

The simple, wood and stone buildings here are the modest living
quarters of Waterdeep's working class.  Many are employed at the
docks, where some live, though a move to the Southern Ward is a step
up from the crime stricken likes of the harbor district.  Metal bars
are built into several of the windows of shops, though few tenants can
afford them on their small apartments, which are often the target of
burgulary.  A few of these buildings are family owned, and some sport
bright colors that accentuate the otherwise dull walk of the Way of
the Dragon.  The street continues here to the east and northward down
a straight cut through the center of Waterdeep.

This open square marks the intersection of two main streets: Coach
and the Way of the Dragon.  To the west begins Net Street and the way
to the harbor, where much of Waterdeep's working class is employed. 
The Way of the Dragon, cutting north to south, marks the dividing line
between the Southern and Dock Wards, and for most Waterdhavens it
represents the dividing line of the middle and lower class.  Coach
Street merges almost exclusively northward onto Dragon, cleaving the
northeast corner of the square into a broad arc, where scarcely a
sidewalk exists anymore.  The storefronts here dwindle, as crime tends
to run rampant in these parts, making it a difficult place to turn a
profit.

The street here is well worn, but also well maintained, as the
coaches make their main run north throughout the city.  On either side
of the street are buildings, stacked so close that scarcely there
remains an alley.  While helping to keep crime down, the lack of any
side thoroughfares makes traffic here somewhat congested, and
moderately dangerous for the pedestrian.  It is important to note that
Waterdeep law does not necessarily protect the pedestrian--oftentimes
a local commoner run down by a speeding coach rider will lose a
dispute because the coach owner is a member of a high ranking family
of nobility.  As such it is every person for themselves in this fast
paced city.

The street continues around a few larger buildings, meandering
gently as it cuts through the Southern Ward.  Just to the west, the
sounds of mooring bells can be heard, as large ships pull into the
largest harbor on the western coast.  The air is cool and crisp, with
a hint of a salty mist lingering.  The local Waterdhavens busy
themselves with all manner of distractions: sitting along the shaded
entrance to an apartment complex, or pruning a tiny garden within a
split barrel, and a few are too busy with their destinations to
consider much else but their stride.  The look of these buildings is
typical of a commoner class, as this Ward is known by few, but lived
in by many.

This street is finely paved in durable flat stones, most likely
pulled from the Dessarin.  They are cut and laid with care, having no
more than a finger's thickness between them.  Most are small stones,
no bigger than the size of an average human's head, and thus they
follow the contours of the road closely.  Heavy traffic has over the
years, upturned a few, which are periodically reset by the guild of
masons.  The Way of the Dragon cuts through the heart of south central
Waterdeep, forming the dividing line between the Southern and Dock
wards.  Here, a strange dichotomy of poverty stricken housing lies to
the east side of the street, while to the west are abandoned and
dilapidated storehouses, too poor a condition even for storage.

Buildings increase in size and stature, as one moves south to north
along the Way of the Dragon.  Decisive class differences can be seen
among the different areas of the city, as high density living has
drawn dividing lines among rich and poor.  The impoverished
Waterdhaven will live in one of two types of places: an old converted
warehouse where several families live in a communal society, or much
more commonly, in a tiny, one room apartment sorely in need of repair.
Sanitation is the poorest here, as waste buckets are discarded upon
the streets when thralls and the city watch is not looking.  For them,
it is an increased burden in their lives to simply toss it down the
sewage hole.  The street continues north and south.

The street narrows as it curves about several tall buildings on
either side.  Resembling almost an alley here, the guild of
lamplighters ensures the safety of Waterdhavens by posting lamps at
every few paces, keeping even the moonless night at bay.  A large
tower structure rises to the east, while along the north and west are
smaller buildings, only a couple of stories, but still among the
largest in the city.  Backs turned to this street, most of the
impressive style is reserved for the other sides, though there still
repeats here the same patterns that are indicative of master work. 
The checkered walk of Diamond Street continues east and south of here.

This north south run is called The Way of the Dragon, legened to
have come from an ancient dragon that once inhabited this area in and
around Mount Waterdeep.  Today, this avenue stands as a testament to
progress, displaying tall, multistoried buildings and all the modern
conveniences such as public trash barrels, underground sewage and
clean, running water.  A dichotomy of newly restored buildings and
old, neglected squats stand row to one alongside one another as the

Tall buildings line the streets, representing some of the more
lavish architecture that can be found in the older Southern Ward of
the city.  The Way of the Dragon marks a dividing line between poverty
and starvation, with the Southern ward to the east and Dock ward to
the west.  The former is where most of Waterdeep's lower and middle
class citizens reside, while Dock ward houses much of the working
class and those who have no home to speak of.  The Way of the Dragon
continues north and south through the heart of the city while a small
alley merges with it from the west.

This long stretch of road rises gently northward as the landscape
bends to the whims of Mount Waterdeep to the northwest.  Many tall,
ornate buildings stand along both sides of the road, many open for
business.  Public works are all around this section of the city, from
fountains to benches, to trash barrels that are operated out of the
local guilds, Waterdeep City is oftentimes regarded as a model city
for how things should be handled.  Beneath the facade, there is
dangers and precarious forces in balance, that seek to overturn the
order and beauty that centuries of peace have forged.  The Way of the

north and south called the Way of the Dragon.  Several multi storied
buildings tower above the streets here, with balconies that wrap
around corners, and in places, roped walkways connecting one window to

The street widens into, appropriately enough, a square elongated on
two opposite corners, or more commonly known as the shape of a
diamond.  At the far apex stands a grand spiraling tower, reminiscent
of a stack of coins, rising high into the sky.  To the south is a wide
temple, fashioned of bluish granite and adorned with the symbol of
nine stars encircling a flame.  This area, known by Waterdhavens as
the city's Temple Diamond District, is elegant in designs.  One of
every popular deity is represented along the raised terrace wall that
separates the street from the garden lawns about the two temples,
offering a feeling of neutrality here, where without it would seem
burdening.  Diamond Street ends and begins here, running west while to
the north runs Delzorin Street.

Weeping Maiden's Run is accented by large, jagged bricks that pave
the road in uneven steps.  In places puddles gather, suggesting a
street in need of repair, or heavy use to pack the foundation.  Here
at the start of the road is embedded a large stone, easily noticeable
from a distance.  Upon it is carved the words "Adventurer's Ward" by
some amateur hand.  To the north, the look of the buildings take on a
cleaner, more modern style, while to the south and east, the
structures are classic wood and stone.  Toward the west is the main
road known as the way of the dragon, and east heads deeper into this
so called adventurer's ward.

Coach Street continues east and west here amidst the fast paced
running of the coaches.  Though not amendable to heavy foot traffic,
this street does have a few notable sites for travelers, though much
of the business here is catered to locals.  The buildings here and
elsewhere in the south ward are simple stone and timber, plain in
appearance and very functional, often packing dozens of tenants per
floor.  A sign stands here designating the area to the north as the
"Adventurer's Ward" while the street sign refers to it as Kerrigan's
Court.

Coach Street is constantly being patched as the heavy coach traffic
takes its toll on the poorly built surface.  Unlike major roads
through Waterdeep, this street was never built for heavy wheeled
traffic, and so significant effort is devoted to its upkeep.  Many of
the buildings here are simple, two or three story dwellings, many once
belonging to prominent families in the early days of Waterdeep's
history.  Many of these homes still retain their quaint exteriors,
though class shifts have since seen these converted to communal
dwellings were as many as 30 Waterdhavians live and interact.  A few
businesses operate along the street, but those are not commonplace. 
Coach Street continues east and west.

This east west street cuts through several distinctly different
looking parts of the city.  Here, there are several plain two and
three story residential buildings, fashioned from red brick and timber
and displaying many windows along the street facing side.  These and
other apartments like it are where the majority of Waterdhavians live.
A few patches of green have been preserved, but otherwise there are
very few park like areas in this district.  A smell of sewage lingers
in the air, suggesting this area is densely populated.  The street
itself is in disarray, with deep ruts cut lengthwise from the
continuous coach traffic.  Here an old warehouse stands to the south,
while Coach Street continues east and west.

Pools of water lie stagnant in deeply carved ruts along the dirt
packed street.  The constant traffic of wheeled carts takes its toll
on the infastructure daily.  This section of street is especially busy
with a major intersection lying west of here and the Adventurer's Ward
a short distance east.  Short multistoried buildings stand along both
sides of the street.  They are old, but structurally in decent looking
condition and would best be described as plain in style.

Coach Street runs east and west, through much of the south part of
Waterdeep.  The coaches run this route, coming from the stables to the
east and spreading out throughout the city.  A gray blockhouse sits to
the south, bellowing smoke from windows and openings as an audible
clanking sound echoes between storefronts.  West leads out into a
chaotic intersection where much of the coaches merge onto the High
Road.

Deep ditches dig into the dirt of Coach Street, criss crossing and
gathering water as the daily rush of coach traffic utilizes this spot
daily.  The street ends and begins here, in a wide open cove designed
to manage the traffic, though the confusion of horse, person and coach
going this way and that makes it seem anything but organized. 
Scarcely are people on foot here, as the many coaches would easily run
them down, and the piles of horse dung make traversing this road by
foot precarious.  To the east are rows upon rows of stables.

An old copper sign depicting the deity Waukeen hangs from a rotting

The walls and floor are splintering from years of neglect and from the
weight of countless items hanging from beams and piled upon shattered
floor tiles.  This looks to be a pawn shop, though hopelessly
cluttered even for the worst of pawns.  Dozens of trinkets,
curiosities and junk are everywhere, some hanging, some buried beneath
other things, and some seemingly set out on makeshift shelving as
displays.  Unfortunately, due to the poor lighting of the room by a
single torch, it is hard for one to see everything there is to offer.

Unfortunately, due to their pursue of the truth, the building does not get
much support or help.  Large complex machinery line the walls and fill the
center of the room here with half printed broadsheets, fully edited
newspapers, and sketches and pictures of certain topics.  A large {ysign{x hangs
from the ceiling here as well, and screams for a visitor's attention.  As
the machines reel and spin, every hour of the day, a smell of ink and heated

of oddities the majority of which are implements for beast tamers such
as whips, chains, leashes, and guiding rods.  Strangely, even a bright

Just north of Waymoot, the great High Road through Waterdeep carries an
abundance of merchants, travellers, and Waterdhavian locals to numerous
places that are of high regard when referring to waterdeep. Here in the
South Ward, much of the land is occupied by residential buildings, most
are multi-storied wood and brick and always housing the maximum allowed
number of people, though it is well known that to avoid taxation, their
owners report no more than three quarters of the true number of tenants.
This has the effect of substantially underscoring census numbers making
the true population of the city a great deal more than what is declared.
The High Road continues north and south, while an old warehouse is east.

gently as it cuts through the Southern Ward.  Just to the west, the
sounds of mooring bells can be heard, as large ships pull into the
largest harbor on the western coast.  The air is cool and crisp, with
a hint of a salty mist lingering.  The local Waterdhavens busy
themselves with all manner of distractions: sitting along the shaded
entrance to an apartment complex, or pruning a tiny garden within a
split barrel, and a few are too busy with their destinations to
consider much else but their stride.  The look of these buildings is
typical of a commoner class, as this Ward is known by few, but lived
in by many.  To the east stands a bustling tavern, where many locals
go for drinks and conversation.

the walls where there aren't any torches though, are some of the most
gorgeous and intricately made paintings of the city of Waterdeep that you

Several storefronts open up in this part of Net Street, where the
last of well to do citizens go to shop, and the first place visitors
see upon disembarking from port.  Further west along the harbor
stretch, few shops are found, as the lots hold more profit utilized as
storage to fuel Waterdeep's vast trade industry.  The buildings here
are in grave disarray, old and seemingly ready to topple over, yet
they are still utilized until the day when they give in.  This is
Waterdeep's economically depressed ward, commonly referred to as the
Lawless Lots.  Sightseers are not welcome here, but money is, so a
compromise is often reached between them.  Net Street continues east
and west.  To the south is a small general store.

This street would be easily missed if one was not looking for it. 
The surface is in disarray, as upturned cobblestones are coarsely
reset and packed with loose gravel and dirt.  Several lamps line the
street, but are either nonfunctioning, or uncontracted by the
lamplighters, such that this street is always dark.  To the east runs
the prominent street known as the Way of the Dragon, while to the
west, Slut Street continues into unknown parts.

This stretch of loosely packed street is accented by scattered
cobblestones filled in with dirt.  As such, this road is in dire need
of maintenance, being heavily traveled from people to and from
Waterdeep's harbor.  Deep ruts cut through its surface, from between
the stones where stagnant puddles of muddy water sit and fester
diseases.  The buildings along this stretch are equally disarrayed,
fashioned of mostly wood, many are nothing more than termites holding
hands.  Here, an old, but nicely decorated building sits to the north.
A strong scent of perfume lingers in the air about it.

This large, dirt packed T-intersection is the basis of where the
wooden docks start, and is a usual delivery route where shipments go
in and out for trade.  The sound of the waves are easily heard from
here as they crash against the underside of the docks and beaches
closeby.  To the north is snail street, and the actual docks start to
the west.

At the docks of waterdeep the wild sea of swords crashes violently
against the dock pillars that hold up the wooden boardwalk you stand
upon now.  Just outside of the docks is the harbor of waterdeep, and
within it are trading ships and many of the guard fleets sailing the
wild waters.  The docks continues at a twisting path, outlining the
edge of the coast, where land meets water.  Many people walk to and
fro, hauling their baggage and large carts filled with cargo.  Ships
continually unload and load, so there are few hours where things do
not seem hectic here.

Net Street opens out onto the boardwalk, as the great Deepwater
Harbor stretches across the east, littered with vertical lines
representing the masts of countless seafaring vessels.  The harbor
begins to the south and runs northward, along another street which
starts just west of here.  Most all buildings here are storehouses,
with a few businesses set up to cater to sailors and the repair of
vessels.  The street itself is a mixture of wood and packed dirt, a
few stones scattered about to ease the wear, though the years have
taken their toll as deep ruts dig their way into the ground.  People
are everywhere, most segregating into two flows: one going toward the
harbor and the other away.  Net Street continues east of here, and
west it intersects with Dock Street.

Here, two streets converge, though one couldn't tell by looking as
everywhere lies scattered crates, barrels, bundles of netting and the
smell of rotting fish.  People go two and fro in all directions,
making this a precarious place to be.  Passengers disembark to the
west, and head east into the city, while crewmen converge from the
east and head to the west to their ships.  Sea captains seem to circle
about, surveying the area and perhaps searching for strong deckhands. 
And then there is everyone else, a good chance them being the lawless
and pickpockets, as not a single city watch is in sight.  Net Street
runs to the east, while Dock Street runs to the north.

The street is part land, part boardwalk, as thick timbers pave the
otherwise precarious drop down to the sea.  Deep ruts have been gouged
out of the timbers, as carts and wagons have taken their toll on them.
The great Sea of Swords opens to the west, spanning as a mighty field
of deep blue, interrupted by a long stretch of sea wall encircling the
harbor.  Along the land side of the street are many buildings, mostly
storehouses and private facilities, offering no hospitality to
seafarers looking for a place to feel at home.  For them, Waterdeep
offers much in the way of enjoyment, though further within the Dock
Ward to the east.  The street continues along the harbor and the rows
upon rows of docks.  To the south, Dock Street merges with Net Street.

Dock street veers to the south and west here, as it follows the
gradual curve of the harbor.  Beneath the boardwalk, sea waves lap up
and spray the air in a salty mist that clings to clothing and burns
the eyes.  The warehouses and ship supply buildings along the
boardwalk here are weathered away from the wind, which blows
continuous day and night, winter or summer, for better or for worse. 
To the east stand a sturdy building, unusually well-built considering
its locale.

Several docks sit side by side along the western fringes of the
shoreline, where Deepwater Harbor drops deep into the sea, offering
her use to even the largest of seafaring vessels.  Few other places in
the realms offer such a diverse harbor.  There are few others able to
moor the great naval ships of Waterdeep, or the mighty trading barges
of Sembia.  There is scarcely any order among the chaos, as deckhands
unload ship after ship, passengers disembark to the city's more
hospitable locales, and crewmen form lines to forfeit months at sea.

from the tossing winds of the ocean to the south and west of here. 
Just a ways out into the ocean can be seen the harbor walls emerged
from within the sea of swords, and the tower of Deepwatch Isle atop

Nearby, the lapping waves of the sea rise up on the piers which
support the long expanse of boardwalk.  Along the shore are numerous
docks, built up to moor the many sea vessels which come to port here. 
Looking closely at the docks, several are floating, as the deep water
makes securing them to the sea floor very difficult, and as such these
floating docks are not suitable for mooring large ships.  For those
that are free standing, there are many large horns for tieing the
mooring ropes.  The street here is half loose paved rocks and half
coarsely cut timbers, as the ground beneath drops to the sea.  Large
ruts are carved into the wood, and in spots between wood and dirt,
making Dock Street somewhat inhospitable to travelers.

The timbers bend beneath the weight of constant traffic, offering
up a precarious scenario whereby innocent bystanders break through the
boardwalk down into the depths below.  A scenario quite possible as
much of the wood from which the docks were built is now weathered and
disintegrating, as the sea licks mercilessly at it.  Along the wide
stretch of docks, there are a few sights, such as the many warehouses,
the countless rows of dock and the many sea vessels that sit just feet
away in the harbor.  Many of the boats are makeshift residences, as
those who have vowed their lives to the sea know no other way to live.

The impending sea laps up from beneath the boardwalk, as crusts of
salt coat the timbers in an almost weathering appeal.  The great
Deepwater Harbor lies to the south, where the harbor wall encloses a
countless clustering of sea vessels, large and small of every shape
and decor.  Far out at sea, one can see the great Deepwatch Isle
tower, used to keep watch over the harbor, and several lesser towers
and lighthouses running the course of the wall.  A thick mist lingers
in the air, as the sea brings with the day a sense of mystery.  Dock

Here, the terrain is slightly higher than the harbor iself, offering

Waterdeep's sea commerce flourishes, if under the guise of lower class

criss cross here and there across the gravel-packed dirt.  Trash lies
all about, gathering at the bases of waste cans and lamp posts, and
trampled into the dirt.  Buildings are short and simple, mostly wood
and straw.  Several shops can be seen every few buildings, selling
items of utility, such as rope nets, steering oars, and thatching
materials.  Others sell food items in an open market style, many
fished from the sea and fresh off the boat.  Snail Street continues

dark corners.  The alley twists and turns between tall buildings and
its way is only evident from looking straight up and following the
crack of light that the sky brings to it.  A soft echoing of people
talking can be heard from the east wall, where there seems to be a
doorway.  Other than that, this spot is unsettlingly silent.  {x

Two large iron gates stand closed here with guards of the watch posted
to uphold Waterdeep's ordinance that no one be allowed within the City
of the Dead after hours. The gates are blackened iron, reddened with a
layer of rust in patches and secured upon two massive stone pillars on
which are carved the likeness of skulls and bones. The wall around the
City of the Dead is tall and crowned with iron spikes, deterring those
who would seek to break the curfew.  The Coffinmarch is west from here.{x

that they could almost engulf unsuspecting victims in a thick tar of

only slightly as it makes it way between the buildings.  Silence
lingers, breaking only momentarily as a stray animal digs through a
trash barrel or the wind stirs a piece of paper.  Gut Alley continues

hard to see what lurks here.  A few piles of trash fill the alley

The moorbells of docking ships sound across the hollowed alleyways
between the tall, timbered buildings.  The dirt swirls in
intersections, reminiscent of the poor conditions of the road, as well
as the amount of use they get.  This street is one of the major
avenues for the dockworkers and couriers who move goods off the ships
to shops and warehouses throughout the city.  Some goods go straight
from the cargo hull to the cart and off to the far reaches of the
realms as traders and merchants seek that glimmer of gold just beyond
the horizon.

The road here is degrading, as much of the loosely packed gravel
and stone has fallen to large heaps alongside the road.  There is a
dim haze of dust that perpetually hangs about from all of the people
and wagon traffic.  Buildings here are mostly made of low quality
timbers, harvested from the nearby forests where logging is still
permitted.  The occasional building made of stone can be seen
scattered amidst rows and rows of wood.  A dark, narrow alley lies to
the west, and across from it a nondescript shop has taken up business.
Snail Street continues north and south.

The architecture takes on a distinctively middle class allure as
one heads north to south.  While due north, the style is artistically
classical, the buildings begin to change into more plain structures,
facilitating function over form.  A mixture of visible stone and wood,
and in some places, traditional thatched roofs make up much of these
latter styles.  The road here is paved in coarse stones and dirt,
packed firmly with excessive use.  Snail Street continues north and
south, through the heart of the Dock Ward.

This unclean, noisy, crowded, gravel-packed dirt road is the prime
example of what the dock area is all about.  There is a dim haze of dust
that lingers in the air from the dirt that gets kicked up from all the
people and wagons passing by.  The building structures are mostly cheap
timber, and many of the buildings are rotting and patched with more wood to
prevent them from falling into a pile of firewood.  Every now and then there
is a stone structure seen looking as if its purpose is to just hold all the
shacks so that they don't collapse.  A rather peculiar looking shop lies to
the east.  It's hard to tell whether it looks different because it's
strange, or because it's just in better shape compare to the other timber
houses around the area.

While north of here in the Sea Ward, the style is artistically
classical, the buildings here are decisively plain and simple.  A
mixture of visible stone and wood, and in some places, traditional
thatched roofs make up much of these structures.  The road here is
paved in coarse stones and dirt, packed firmly by the large crowds
that travel this area day and night.  Dust is always in the air,
except when heavy rain pounds it into mud.  Though somewhat less than
pleasant conditions, even the lowest class areas of Waterdeep offer
running water and clean sewage removal, making this truly a City of

The decrepit condition of the road is obvious: slabs of once
mortared stone jut up in places, as in others coarse dirt and rocks
sit packed into the earth.  Large pools of water gather in low places,
as streaks of mud draw lines with the flow of traffic.  Buildings lean
this way and that, as their stone and wood structures fight to keep
them upright.  The smell of the sea industry saturates the air in
salty, fishy smells that one has to be accustomed to before it becomes
passing.  People who pass do so without concern of bumping into one
another, and all around there seems to be lacking the spark of li
countless droves continue about their daily grind.  Snail street
continues north and east of here.

The street curves about here as it meanders between the unevenly
partitioned city blocks.  Centuries of social progress has hardly put
a dent into the stubborn layout of the Dock Ward, as warehouses share
streetfronts with vegetable stands, and stables double as makeshift
quarters for seafarers skimping on a decent room at the nearest inn. 
Scarcely were roads even considered as greedy enterpeneurs pushed
their businesses further and further into the streets, in places
completely blocking lanes that otherwise spilled into the opposite
walkways.  These tinderbox buildings are frequently threatened by
fires, and only then when licked clean by flame do they yield to
social stability, molding these streets slowly into maneuverable
grids.  Snail Street makes an S curve here, west and south, and to the
east curves another street, creatively named Slut.

Continuing north and south is Snail Street, as the swiftness by
which people pass two and fro give rise to questions regarding the
origin of this street's name.  Perhaps it is not the traffic it
describes as much as the people: apathetic, dirty faces stare out from
street corners, as the lower class lull away the afternoon.  Many
spend their shifts at harbor or even out at sea, fishing and careering
one of the several hundred vessels that utilize Waterdeep's well
equipped harbor.  Much of the city's industry is spawned from the sea,
as is much of the city's noxious smells that drift with the winds,
especially in the late afternoon.

Many of the buildings here are wood, with some stone sparsely
placed as foundation holders.  In places such as the Trade Ward, stone
foundations are common, and often sport a clean wash of color to
brighten up the look.  Here, the stones are locally scavenged from the
sea, sporting the look of dried barnacles and thick moss that gives it
anything but a look of brightness.  The timbers are darkened,
suggested they spent many months in water as the northeastern lumber
yards float them down the Dessarin.  Some sport layers of oozing pitch
to prevent rot, but not all, as some have already rotted near clean
through.  A strange odor of rot and fish lingers in the air.  To the
west stands a somewhat nicer building, most likely used for cargo
storage.

Swirls of dust gather in shallow alleyways as people trod across
the dirt road in search of their destination.  There is very little
remarkable about this part of the city, a bustling ward with a diverse
crowd, and poorly kept by the city.  Trash line the gutters, which are
hardly effective during rain, as most are full of mud washed from the
unpaved streets.  The buildings sink inward, leaning into the streets
in places where the foundation has fallen, and yet most are still
being used for business, storage, and even apartment homes.  Housing
here is very affordable, oftentimes only a few gold pieces a night,
though accomidations are less than hospitable, so only the brave or
desperate need seek shelter here.  Snail Street continues north and
south, passing a long row of warehouses to the west.

The streets are overcrowded as the traffic from Net Street to the
south overflows into Snail Street, which starts here and heads north
through the heart of the Dock Ward.  This is one of the older wards in
the city, and the least upkept, as unpaved streets and decrepit
buildings accent the empire of seafaring that has kept the silver
coming in.  If one is in search of sea adventurer or a group to take
to the waters in piracy, this is the ward to scavenge through.  A
large storehouse stands to the west.

engulfs this modest avenue, which has seemingly no other use here than
to grant access to a rather shady looking nightclub just south of

seems to be piled back on the ruts from time to time.  Tall buildings
tower on either side of the street, but it is their backs which are
turned this way, as trash barrels and waste water trickle out into the
street.  A few stray animals linger about, but otherwise not a lot of
sights are worth mentioning here.

Small shacks and worn down brick houses and shops surround you. 
The smell of smoke and rancid food is prevalent and seems that the
origination of it all comes from a smoke house just east of here.  The
loosely set cobblestones of Slut Street protrude from the road, making
it inhospitable for cart or carriage.  A rather inviting smell lingers
in the air, as aromatic smoke bellows from the Smokehouse to the east

Probably once a long dark alley, this street has been poorly turned
into a commercial walkway.  The road is an interesting mix of dirt,
cobblestone, and gravel randomly spread along the street - probably
created from the scraps and leftovers from other roads.  The borders
of the street are lined with the backs of tall stone buildings while
there are occasional commercial building entrances up and down the
road.  To the north is an old wooden tattered warehouse.

villas--the homes of Waterdeep's nobility, with their impressive, if
not gaudy, spires, decorative balconies, and intricate stonework,
these structures delight the senses, and spark a sense of intrigue. 
Curiosity is only fueled by the tall walls which block in each home,
maintaining the residence privacy while offering but a glimpse at
their insides.  Along the road are set baskets for the couriers, who
do very well for themselves here in the noble district.

toward Castle Waterdeep by means of Soothsayer Way to the west.  Paved
in near perfectly square cut blocks accented with iron struts along
either side, The square is a mark of excellence and craft for the
city, representing a gateway to the monarchy, and an avenue for

who gathered here in masses to proclaim the prophecies, some proven
truer than others, to the king and his city.  This wide street is also
a popular staging grounds for large groups who come seeing audience
with the king and queen, as well as a commons area for the citizens of
the city when summoned by the monarchy.  As such, it is a center of
culture and history that reflects in the architecture and in the faces
of those who call this area home.

to deliver the daily tidings to the king and queen.  To the east,

This huge warehouse is tightly stacked with heavy metal crates that equal
the size of 100 feet by 100 feet square each!  Locks and chains swing around
each crate hugging them closed for even extra security measures.  On each
metal crate is a signet marking that looks somewhat like a {#golden{0

"Boats Sold Here".  A large check in and check out desk is in the far
back of this room where a pre-set quill in ink has been prepared for
any signature bindings for people who decide to rent a boat or buy. 
The wooden walls here seem to have white crusty covering to them that
looks like it might be some kind of powdered salt that has drifted
from the oceanic water of the Great Harbor of Waterdeep.

This is a quiet tavern with a small collection of tables, benches, and
mismatched stools for its patrons.  Most of the tables have elaborate
carvings in their surfaces from the daggers of past patrons - there might
even be some messages left within the general scrawls and carvings of
useless graffiti.  Its only light filters in through filthy windows during
the day, a tallow candle chandelier providing light at night.  The back wall
is decorated with some tapestries which most likely hung in a noble villa
once, but are now so threadbare and stained by smoke and spilled ale that
they are nearly worthless.  The washrooms are accessed by two ladders in the
floor, while stairs lead up to a few bedrooms and a party room.

The street bends here, coming in close proximity with the north
trollwall, which can be seen through alleyways to the northeast of
here.  Nearly every building here is a home, a very large home in
fact, and most are blatantly showy, expressing form over function in
every facet.  Perhaps one building on every city block serves some
other function, be it a storage building, or the occasional shop,
catering to the basic needs of visitors and residence.  The shops do
not bar anyone from entering, but do expect money to be spent within,
and if you pay a visit, expect to pay a high price for even the most
basic of essentials.

Nearly every friendly, civilized race is represented in the crowds that
travel this road daily.  The High Road is a vital link within Waterdeep
and beyond, connecting trade routes as far north as Mirabar on the edge
of the Spine of the World. An influx of goods run through here each day,
from exotic foods, to high demand equipment and black market items, and
even mercenaries come through here, hoping to land some work. There are
many taverns and inns advertising off the road, though most locals will
say they are overpriced and lacking in hospitality, but rather the good
places to be are buried several blocks off this beaten path. Still, the
shops and businesses which set up along the road enjoy healthy revenues.

shops are set up along the sides of the road but otherwise this part of

on in plain sight.  Though two streets meet here, any likeness of River

River Street continues its short stretch here, connecting the River
Gate to the east with the rest of the city to the west.  The River
Gate is one of the latter added entries into Waterdeep, as trade
routes opened up to river travel, there grew a need to move trade
traffic from the main gates, south and north, where congestion was
becoming an issue.  Mainly used by the ferrier traffic, the River Gate
is frequently congested with large carts, coaches, and beasts that
travel the short distance to the nearby warehouses along the north and
further into the Sea Ward.  This part of Waterdeep is characterized by
foul odors and unkept streets, which have over the years been
subjected to much heavy traffic.

The River Gate opens here, spanning across two massive gate doors,
reinforced with hardened iron.  Used almost exclusively by the river
traders, these gates at one time represented a weak link in the city's
defenses, as raiding parties floated down the river and ambushed the
unsuspecting guards, causing a short-lived, though realistic danger to
the ci In response, the gates are closed at night, open only by
request to late traveling ferrymen who are familiar to the guards. 
Even with such precautions, danger still exists, though the prospect
of enduring a large scale invasion from the river is faint to none.

This narrow road is known as Sleeper's Walk, for some because the
flow of traffic comes to near a halt as one approaches the City of the
Dead.  To a select few, it is a place where enchantment takes hold and
forces unsuspecting victims into a slumber, where later they are moved
to the graveyard, their valuables taken.  For the most part, this is a
safe area, as there are numerous people around at all hours of the day
and the city watch patrols it heavily.  A vibrantly colored shop lies
to the east, while a main artery of Waterdeep opens to the south.

the worship of all deities. Along the High Road, many shops, inns and

A slight bend in Immar Street follows the northern trollwall as it
curves along the northeast side.  Between the street and the walls are
somewhat smaller homes, no less elegant in design, but they stand as a
testament to harder times, when the northern trolls were a constant
threat to the city.  The thinking was that if homes be destroyed in
their siege, then let those closest to the walls go first--a sentiment
which echoes in the unusually tall walls erected about the narrow row
of homes against it.

seems large enough for a ship to traverse, should Waterdeep ever fall
victim to flooding. The prospect of this is slim, given that the city
has one of the most advanced sewage systems in all the realms.  Along
the road are set generous numbers of lamps kept well-lit by the light
man, whose only job it is to walk up and down the street lighting the

flames one by one.  Just off the road to the north is a big shop with

people of all look and profession, some sitting on heaps of gear, and
others standing with only the packs on their back.  Virgin's Square is
named from an old pagan myth that virgins were sacrificed on this
ground where dragons once gathered by their dens in Mount Waterdeep. 
The tale takes hold of many imaginations, and this is a popular
meeting point for parties of all sort.  With the tale also is the
prosect of adventuring, and so Virgin's Square is also utilized by
mercenaries as a staging ground for exhibition, in hopes of being
hired to a job.  If one is in search of a worthy warrior to join them

desperately wished to live among the most powerful denizens of
Waterdeep.  Barring the availability of space, or the great price to
buy out current tenants, this for some was the only way to be here. 
The small villas are built tall, but narrow, and from the front look
just as lavish as those that lie elsewhere.

You enter a wide square, more aptly a circle, where the High Road veers
back north through the city and east across a brief spell in its trace.
This circle marks the center of the City of Spendors marked with sights
and sounds which please and overwhelm the senses. Just to the southwest
stands the majestic Waterdeep Castle, nestled within the highly rumored
Undermountain.  The streets are alive with trade as wagons and carts of
all sorts roll by you all heading to and fro the great market northwest
of here.  Streets and avenues continue into all four directions leading
out into the City of Splendors. A large statue stands about a fountain.

Numerous signs extend from the buildings attempting to catch the eye of

doors, waving and calling to people to stop and rest a spell before the
journey ahead.  Many take him up on the offer, as the doors remain open.

Tall, grey-stoned buildings dominate this section of the road, each one
peppered with many dark-paned windows.  Plants and other assorted items
are scattered about the many window sills, hinting that these buildings
are mainly used as living quarters for the middle class. The occasional
resident leans out of their window, watching the many people who travel
the road day in and day out. The High Road continues on north and south.

The High Road continues north and south through Waterdeep, here ongoing
on a long stretch of wide, bustling street.  Being the widest street in
the whole City of Spendors, some of the most impressive buildings stand
about the road.  Jutting out from seemingly every brick and stone are a
myriad of signs and banners beckoning patrons to whatever establishment
each represents. Just to the east is a tall, flamboyant shop displaying
all manner of costumes and bright colored clothing. Various dark alleys
line either side of the road, leading into the lesser known underground.

This high traffic road is lined with majestic architecture ranging from
timber and wattle-and-daub to solid stone structures. All buildings in
this ward are at least two stories high, most are between two and three
and a select few are in excess of five stories. Numerous signs reach to
the streets from the buildings, demanding the attention of the many who
pass this way in hopes of luring them inside. To the west is a big shop
from whence the sound of hammering metal can be heard. In the window is
perhaps the most elegant set of armor you have ever seen--richly ornate
in precious metals and stones and glowing with a seemingly magical aura.

Along the busy avenues of the high road, people take the streets by the
swarms leaving very little room to walk comfortably. Their only concern
seems to be the faster passing carts that would run them down otherwise.
To the west is a large magical looking building devoted to some sort of
important group. The east is segregated by an ominous wall behind which
is a partially restricted place. On the wall are painted the likenesses
of bones and skulls and symbols of death, home of the City of the Dead.

The shop here is extremely clean and tidy not like most stores which
operate in the Trade Ward. Four torches line each wall of this store
making it almost too bright for the inside of a building. Where bare
walls would be hang some of the most detailed paintings depiciting a
glimpse of city life - an indoor scene of merrymakers indulging at a
spot called the Thirsty Throat, a tall colorful painting of the Bell
Tower near Castle Waterdeep, which is painted in the background, and
a depiction of the Yawning Portal Inn, one of Waterdeep's oldest inn
and tavern.  One would think this an art gallery, but at the counter

The traffic here is a little heavier than the nearby streetways, as
Immar intersects with Whaelgond Way to the south.  Despite that, it is
not at all busy compared with the most of Waterdeep, as the north ward
is known for being relatively quiet and eventless.  If events did
happen, it would be hard to tell as near every home is accented with
high windows, or closed walls, or both.  A few shops have set up here,
as several people take to buying their essentials, rather than making
a trip to the bazaar.

The High Road continues through Waterdeep City--the extra wide street
seems large enough for a ship to traverse, should Waterdeep ever fall
victim to flooding. The prospect of this is slim, given that the city
has one of the most advanced sewage systems in all the realms.  Along
the road are set generous numbers of lamps kept well-lit by the light
man, whose only job it is to walk up and down the street lighting the
lamps, and then back around to put each one out when the sun rises in
the east. The faint sounds of mooring bells can be heard far westward.

This short, and narrow road is constructed of a cobblestone base,
and the surrounding buildings are mostly made of timber.  The street
is noticebly not very well kept due to the garbage found frequently
littering the corners of where the buildings meet the road.  A
brightly lit shop is to the west with large, glass window panes. 
Inside the glass windows hang some uniquely made glass sculptures, as
well as some other useful glass materials.  To the north, the street

Sleepers Walk narrows to the southern gates of the City of the
Dead, directly north of here.  The narrowing of all roads leading into
the graveyard is a tradition that takes root in the idea of lessening
the flow of dead Waterdhavians to the grave.  Still, death is a thing
to be celebrated in as much as it is mourned, and the gates and walls
of the graveyard are rich in ornate detail, almost beautiful in
design.  Here and elsewhere within the graveyard shadows one can find
artistic inspiration, colorful characters, and adventure abound.  To
the north is the City of the Dead, while Wall Way begins west of here,
meandering about the former.

which are carved the likeness of skulls and bones. The wall around the

Between the street and the wall are many small vendor stalls that
serve to cheapen and in some respects disrespect the memory of the

stopped short of an order from the king or a decree from the secretive
lords.  No such decree has yet been issued.

ordinance which governed the establishment of streets and roads stated
the requirement that Wall Way remain one city lot away from the walls
of the graveyard, which it follows carefully, however there was no
requirement made that nothing else could be placed at the wall, and
thus was born a myriad of small buildings, kiosks, and vendor stalls. 
To the south, a beautifully decorated guildhall stands adorned with a

ancient times, other gates to the graveyard were utilized, as tombs
were constructed along the perimeter of the enclosure, but as space
became limited, individual graves were removed, and an intricate
network of tombs were constructed to accomidate an unlimited number of
the city's dead.

today as the City of the Dead.  Its purpose is still such, though much
of the avenue is devoted to dignified processionary images of watchful
guards and symbols, though purposely devoid of any permanent religious
imagery.  Several small vessels line the walkway, where fresh flowers
are placed for every funeral, which can accomidate as many as 50 dead

buildings there are one story squats, used either as rental properties
or storage.  To the north is a drastic change, as tall, elegant villas
begin to spring up and fight for dominance.  Here at the southern half
of the north ward is but a taste of the obscene wealth of these
villas--usually the less wealthy nobles or ones with "new money" build
or reside here, in an attempt to put their foot in the door for more
lucrative accomidations up the road.

This tiny shop has been interiorly designed to house three shelves both
on the east and west walls where many assortments of footwear can be put on
display and sold.  A very recognizable smell of tanned leather fills the
shop, as well as the polish used on leather boots that need a rejuvination
of their look.  On the counter to the south a pair of leather riding boots
have been bronzed as a trophy for some occasion.

This lavishly designed inn is obviously one of high expense.  The walls
have all been intricately made into tile murals which probably took over two
years total to make.  The tables have been fashionably designed straight
from pure glass, and the illumination for the inn is emitted by a dozen or
so, flashy lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  A counter to the east, which
looks to be solid oak, has been sanded down and stained a golden brown to
give it a richness in look.

A near perfect view of the countryside can be seen here, to the
east where the city of Waterdeep is naturally protected by a 100-foot
cliff.  Named the Cliffwatch, this small stretch of unobstructed
perimeter is the only part of the city not protected by a wall, though
two large towers at either end prevent intrusions from the sky, or
attempts at land.  When the fog drifts in from harbor, seeing the
cliff's edge can be difficult, and so the entirety of the cliff edge
is protected by a short, 3 foot wired wall, which does little more
than stop an average human from just walking off to their doom. 
Still, stories of jumpers or fallers are common here, whether it be
suicides, accidents or premeditated acts made to look like the former
two.  The city watch investigates any and all incidents, and
Cliffwatch is heavily patrolled.

serves as one of the major routes to Castle Waterdeep to the

characteristic of the Castle Ward, and marks some of the most
beautiful scenery in all of the city.  Far to the west are the castle

The street widens as the great gates of the Field of Triumph opens
to the north, the colliseum rising high there, covering several city
blocks and drawing in a huge crowd.  The citywatch is heavy here as
well, as illicit trade and barter runs rampant, along with
pickpocketing and swindling, though such transgressions are often seen
being met with drawn blades.  Just to the south, several
establishments capitalize on the crowds, though their plots are narrow
and rocky, as the cutaway cliffs of Mount Waterdeep rises sharply
behind them.  Space is scare and valuable here, and the barren rocky
cliffs to the south bear testament to the difficulty in utilizing the
terrain.  Julthoon continues east, while ending a short distance west
at the Trollwall and Westwall Street.

it's inner sanctum looks as big as a mountain itself.  The thick iron bars
are wider than an elephant's leg, and probably could not even be bent by the
strongest of titans.  Guards stand guard here attentively, watching
everyone's move suspciously.  The crest of waterdeep found on the guards'

atop the towers of this great castle.  To the west lies the great courtyard
of waterdeep castle, while east takes you away, back onto soothsayer's path.

kept clean and ordered, governed by strict curfews and regulations on
what people can do here.  Who can sell and who can live within these

elegant buildings abound in the ward, characteristic by the secondhand
stones and chipping paint used in building them, though very few
people care, because no one really walks this way anyway.  The west

take quite the interest while others try to squeeze by the area with a

dazzling display of colors mark both the merchant garbs and their tiny
kiosk carts, which are used as devices to lure the unsuspecting into a

The High Road continues through the city, connecting the northern and
southern roads on both ends of Waterdeep which define one of the most
important trade veins of this part of the realms. So important is the
Trade Way-High Road trade route that Waterdeep has enacted active and
aggressive patrols along much of the close lying lengths. Bandits and
would be con men are discouraged from their illicit activities within
the city limits. Instead many choose to conduct business just off the
beaten path, or in dark alleys were few guards patrol. Crime is still
predominant in Waterdeep, though many consider it healthy to commerce.

Just off the High Road, Delzorin Street ventures through the north
ward district, passing the grand villas of the nobility of Waterdeep. 
While such extravagant homes are also seen elsewhere, namely in the
sea and castle wards, none take on more of a traditional and massive
scale as those found here.  These are the homes of the established
nobility: the "old money" as some refer to them.  Many see living here
as a respectable place to retire and live life at a slower pace. 
Crime in this ward is very low, but so is the prospect of adventure. 
The city watch patrols these streets relentlessly, as the watchmen are
paid very well for very little work.  Delzorin continues east through
the north ward, and west it intersects with the main artery of the
city: the High Road.

The streets are quiet, as much of this part of the city is.  Lavish
villas sit along both sides of the roadway, their patterns broken on
occasion by a quaint patch of green and several large old trees.  This
part of the city is maintained very well, and crime is perhaps at its
lowest here, as there is rarely a moment between seeing one city watch
patrol and another.  Passerbys are extravagantly dressed in the garb
of nobility, and rarely do they bother to make eye contact, especially
with a stranger or one inclined at adventuring.

Immar street continues east and west here, with the noble villas
lining both sides of the street.  Space is at a premium in Waterdeep
yet here is where one can get a glimpse at what it was like before
this was the case.  The homes are wide and tall, and many show off
large gardens, some larger than the grand foyers and dining halls
which many also house within.  Such a seeming waste of space is rarely
tolerated, though easily overlooked if one has money or is a member of
a powerful family.  Also the case, if your home happens to be several
hundred years old, then gardens and such are more easily overlooked.

This majestic street runs through some of the most popular sites in
the northern part of Waterdeep, from Fetlock Court just south of here,
to the Palace Grounds, the base of Mount Waterdeep, and through the
temple district.  Buildings are beautiful artforms here, fashioned
from marble and granite, and adorned in detailed relief carvings that
represent some of the finest masterworks in the city.  Beauty is
predominant here, as many of the temples exhibit pricy features meant
to lure followers within, and hopefully straight to the donation box. 
The street continues north and south.

The Street of Silks gets its name from the silk trade which once
brought prominence to this small section of Waterdeep.  Today,
commerce moved further east, and this ward became a center for
religous worship.  Many elegant temples and shrines lie scattered
throughout, at almost every turn of the corner.  Buildings are lavish,
expensive, and represent some of the best that Waterdeep has to offer
in architecture.  To the west, a shrine devoted to Tyr rises tall and
narrow, its white marble stairs spilling out into the street.

Soft, smooth marble line this street, as marble temples adorned
with silken tapestries play upon the name of the Street of Silks. 
Originally known for spawning the silk trade in Waterdeep, this area
has since grown from a bustling commercial district, to a reverent
temple ward, but the secular flare of adornment still remains.  Most
buildings here are older structures, as rain and the elements have
streaked and pitted the once smooth marble, though considerable time
and energy is spent maintaining the luster.  The city contractors
spend three weeks out of each year painting prominent buildings with
hot wax, to maintain a lasting gleam and protect surfaces from the
weather.  The Street of Silks continues north and south.

The sounds of the sea can be heard not far to the west, as just
beyond the narrow line of buildings, the western trollwall gives way
to the Sea of Swords.  This part of Waterdeep City is known
collectively as the Sea Ward, based on its proximity to the sea,
though many have come to refer to it as the Temple Ward, or the Ward
of Nobles, as many prominent families call this place home.  The
Street of Silks continues north and south, while to the east lies a
shop filled with an assortment of items of all needs and tastes.

Several older structures besides temples and villas exist in this
part of Waterdeep City, namely old wizard's towers from back when such
things were fashionable.  Though age and the elements have beaten down
on them, they still remain miraculously, or perhaps magically, inta
The defining feature of this stretch of street are the decorate
banners and tapestries which hang on the tall buildings on either
side.  A bow to the age when the silk trade brought much needed
revenue to this once depressed area of Waterdeep, many of these
decorative elements are made from pure silk.

You walk into a high ceiling building, separated by a vast open
area from entrance to end.  Robed scholars walk about talking and
comparing writings and ideas, while along the walls several apprentice
scriveners attend to their daily lessons.  Several squared support
pillars divide the room roughly into thirds, reserving the largest
divide to the center area.  Many artistic renderings and calligraphy
of ancient mottos hang about the pillars and side walls.  The most
striking and quizzical feature of all is the blank wall that stands
two stories across the room, at the far end.  Several occular openings
illuminate the wall, which appears as a smooth, barren slab of stone.

This street is elegantly paved in marble, with some semiprecious
stone laid in discreet intervals, giving a nod from when this was one
of the most wealthiest districts in the city.  Still today, it remains
a high profile area, holding many religious shrines and temples, and
some of the most wealthy citizens in Waterdeep.  In that time too,
many powerful wizards settled here in daft stone cathedral like
buildings and more traditional towers, many of which survived the
countless arcane experimentation to stand here still today.  One such
tower lies up the ridge to the northwest--a narrow black form
resembling an ebony quarterstaff stuck upright in the dirt.

Sulmor ends just west of here, at Sul Street, making way for a
monumental temple complex built across the road, and well before this
street had been established by the council of elders in Waterdeep's
youth.  Remnants of the ancient times are still visible in moss
covered rocks that jut from the ground--old foundations long ago razed
by trolls and rebuilt to withstand their attacks.  The paving of the
main road is much newer, less than a century, as evident by the still
jagged edges on some stones.  On both sides of the street, tall villas
and spired temples spill out almost to the sidewalk.

The two celestialesque avenues, Sul and Sulmor converge at this

red brick paving of Sul stops abruptly to make way for the more bold
stone lined surface of Sulmor.  Buildings here are grand structures,
though clearly not the outward facing side, as secondary architectural
elements-small arches and window accents are visible out to the
street.  Modest stairways lead up into buildings, having long learned
that flooding can make low lying floors less than hospitable.

has nary been a century gone by since a major attack on the city took
place, a fact that can be seen in the age of the homes here--old
masonry accented with traditional styles.  Style itself is ageless
here, as the homes are mostly of the old times, which modern archtects
revere and emulate to this day.  It is not uncommon to find villas in
the sea ward which look strangely similiar to the more authentically
old homes found here, though for both price and history, there is no

Warrior's Way cuts through the center of Waterdeep, north and south
through the district of warriors, mercenaries, and weapons masters of
all kind.  Along the road are many private guilds dedicated to near
every weapons trade known, most reputable, but many operating beneath
the streets, under the cloak of darkness.  Though the city watch keeps
close eye on these suspected dark guilds, they are for the most part
left to mingle with the rich diversity of the city.  Harmless or not,
it is understood that given a long enough building of power, all such
places of unrest will eventually take their battles to the foot of
immortals, where the true balance of powers are rechecked.  A few
private storage houses line this particular section of the street.

Stay in one place long enough, and one can see the whole spectrum
of weapons being carried by people of all trades of battle.  This is
Warrior's Way, where recognized and self proclaimed warriors loiter
about and otherwise make their way north to the bazaar to set
theirselves out as mercenaries for hire.  The buildings here are a mix
of wood and stone, both traditional and modern architectures, and
housing some of the most well known and notorious guilds of warfare in
all of Waterdeep.  To the east is set up an apothecary shop, while

Warrior's Way, as the avenue opens up to a vast open market further
north.  There are less battle-inclined things to see here, with more
general stores and even a few residential buildings strewn cluster of
timber and stone structures.  The streets are paved in fine
cobblestone--worn with age and bowing down the center from cart
traffic, where puddles gather and birds bask and bathe.  Colorful
flags and banners reach out into the streets, advertising patriotism
for fellow Waterdhavens, or the new smith opening up on the corner.

Warrior's Way continues north and south, through some of
Waterdeep's more utilitarian offerings.  Most structures here are
basic wood and stone, butting closely against narrow sidewalks
fighting for precious space.  Materials prevent these buildings from
scaling to more than two or three stories, and so most leave little
room for alleyways or courtyards.  The narrow sidewalks are frequently
packed with people, and in places mercenaries are setup displaying
their skills in hopes of being bought along an adventure.  Much of the
foot traffic spills out into the street, so cart and horse traffic
slows considerably here, making Warrior's Way less used as a
thoroughfare than a place to inefficiently get from point A to point
B.

{!Julthoon Street{0~
~
Julthoon opens into a T intersection, as the Street of Silks begins
south on its run down the length of Waterdeep.  Fewer temples lie in
the southern half of this ward, as ornate buildings vacate the
mystical for the more mundane.  Cathedrals make way for castles, as
Waterdeep's governing body lies south and west in the palace complex
just at the base of Mount Waterde east leads back to the central
bazaar, west to the Street of the Singing Dolphin and further to the
great arena of the city, where the bravest warriors battle one another
for honor.

{!Julthoon Street{0~
~
The street begins a gradual climb upwards along a slope, as the
base of Mount Waterdeep protrudes far into the city.  A few of the
more prominent buildings here are terraced on level ground, excavated
from the sloping mountain base, but for those less established
structures, there's is an architecure unique to the plot they reside. 
Most are old cathedral-like buildings, many still temples of worship,
while others have long been converted to other more mundane places,
such as government owned housing and meeting rooms for lesser
established guilds.  To the northwest rises a narrow, black tower,
reminiscent of an ebony stick, stuck in the ground with a can about
its base.  Directly south of here is an elegant temple, with a
brightly painted rayed sun upon the archway.  The temple of Lathander.

The sounds of the Bazaar can be heard just east of here, as
Julthoon Street continues east and west through Waterdeep.  The tall
buildings along either side of the street overshadow the bustle of
daily life below.  A few inviting anemities can be found scattered
throughout--a bench, a bright streetlamp, and a trash barrel, though
not as many people use the latter as would be hoped.  A few vendors
are set up about here, but mostly commerce is confined to the central
Bazaar, or to the trades ward further east near the City of the Dead.

Waterdeep: Sul and Julthoon, though the merging is concealed by a
blanket of Bazaar commerce and people.  There is scarcely a straight
stretch across or through this area, making detours very lucrative for
those wishing to get to and fro in a hurry.  Many of the stalls seem
randomly placed, while others seem purposely planted in the middle of
the square, to force one to see it.  Though the rules of commerce are
highly regulated here, these regulations seem to blur on the edges as
vendors line up seemingly without rhyme or reason.  {x

{!Julthoon Street{0~

This avenue is constructed of large 3 feet squares fitted closely
together to create a very stable, and smooth walking ground.  Its unique
road construction is due to its usage of heavy wagons and carts that are
continuously traveling from the high road to the bazaar, or even further
west, the great arena colliseum.  The building structures here are all made
of stone, and a few broken wagons lay spread out along their sides most
likely from overusage at the bazaar.

A large avenue cuts through the city of Waterdeep west to east. 
This street, known as Julthoon connects the main artery of the city,
the High Road just east of here, to the bustling Bazaar at the center
of the City of Splendors, through to such sights as Khelben's black
tower and the great colliseum on the western edge of the city. 
Buildings here are mostly stone with some wood, all large and old,
having been firmly established in the heart of the city.  Though a bit
of a relief from the bustling High Road, this street is still one of
the busiest in town.

Julthoon is one of Waterdeep's most traveled streets, cutting
through the northern half of the Castle Ward and passing some of the
higher profile buildings of the city.  Just south of here rises a
ridge along the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, where a dark wizard's tower
looms in strange, almost mystical haze.  To the north, the merry
street of Dolphins begins, passing by many temples and shrines, and
just to the northwest the sounds of the great Field of Triumph can be
heard echoing through alleyways.  Not far to the west is the trollwall
near the Cliffwatch, where the cliffs of Deepwater Harbor begins,
dropping down many paces as it cuts south through Waterdeep's bustling
seafaring industry.

Just outside the colliseum of waterdeep is a grand stairway spanning at

stone archway has been chiseled into and articulately designed into the head
of a great lion.  It's massive teeth descend down below the arch at the
entrance and have crumbled a bit most likely due to people - mostly kids -
entering the stadium and jumping up to touch the structure.  Just beyond the
mouth of the lion is a grand hallway leading to the inner fighting grounds
of the colliseum.

this street, its name as solemn and inviting as the clean sidewalks

as the old nobles prefer this remain a residential street, and any
trouble is frowned upon in this district.  Nearby, the sounds of many
people can be heard, beyond the Lion gate leading into the Field of
Triumph.  They are perhaps celebrating the recent emancipation of
Triboar to the north, which has for many years been at odds with
Waterdeep over trade dispute

in homes of Waterdeep save Piergeiron's Palace.  Some of the most
grandest homes of Waterdeep reside here, and it shows in the wonderous
structures that surround the street.  Spires, and gables of noble
villas are sporadically placed along with temples devoted to the some
of the more popular gods and goddesses of Faerun.  The structures have
an air of stateliness and majesty, and the variety of building details

Two large avenues intersect here, but the square remains modest,
lacking in the many gatherings and merchants which are characteristic
of others throughout the city.  This is due to the ordinance of the
district, that trade be regulated and large gatherings shunted, to
maintain peace and order in this old ward.  The noble houses rise up
on all sides, and here several large turrets from ancient towers hang
over into the intersection, shading the road from the sometimes
relentless sun.

of the homes in Waterdeep, aside from those found in and about the
palace grounds.  Second to these noble villas are those found in the
north ward, though all styles converge to here, as wonderous
structures surround the street, accented by ornate gables and rising
spires that clip the sun in a million rays of light.  Temples continue
this elegance in style, and the diversity of buildings here is

The wind between buildings can clearly be heard here, partly due to
the high plateau which makes up the cliffwatch to the east, and partly
due to the silence abound in this part of the city.  The local
nobility which live here are of the older generation, sometimes more
respected than "new money" but always given the best that Waterdeep
has to offer in terms of accomidations, tax breaks, and amenities. 
These villas are strikingly beautiful, some almost gaudy in their
design, but all of them are interesting to gaze upon in this stretch
of street.  Saerdown street intersects to the south, while Immar

The name of this street is a bow to its solemn and inviting
stature, as well as the beauty that can be seen all about.  Some of
the most beautiful buildings can be seen here, mostly temples and
shrines, but the occasional mansion rises in competition with the
former.  A popular site in Waterdeep, the Sea Ward has often been
referred to as the temple district, and for many Waterdhavens, this is
a daily sight for their worship.  To the west, the wall is overgrown
with flowering vines such that scarcely a brick can be seen.

Sulmor Street continues east and west here, cutting through a
wealthy cluster of villas where the nobles live.  These villas are
striking in their design: very little wood, as most are stone and iron
constructs representing gaudy and bold styles which are masterworks of
local guildsmen.  Despite the shortage of space in the city, many of
these homes display lush gardens, patios and balconies from which
their residence can watch the going ons of the city, without taking
part in it themselves.  Known as one of the quietest and most
leisurely walks, some go as far as saying the neighborhoods here are
boring, though what goes on behind closed doors is anything but.

Here, the ground is barren, packed dirt. Not a single pave stone can be
found set about anywhere about this stretch of open space and in a city
where space is at a premium, this lot would normally fetch a high value
to those interested in developing it, however this is no ordinary court.
The Court of the White Bull holds a special place in Waterdhavian lore.
Named from a tavern which once stood here, the structure was leveled in
a great spell battle which was said to have tore a planar breach to the
Astral Plane.  Later this breach was purportedly repaired by Azuth, but
still to this day there are eddies of wild magic about, and a curse for
anyone wanting to build here--no permanent structure will survive here.{x

Diamond street leads out from the city to the west gates and into
the city east where it eventually intersects with the High Road
through Waterdeep.  Along both sides of the street are many elegant
displays of architecture, from highly ornate gables to dizzyingly tall
spires, which decorate the homes of nobility.  Occasionally, there
stands a somewhat plain building, heavily constructed of stone and
iron, and capped with a tall tower which effortless rises above the
other homes nearby.  These are the towers of wizards, who on occasion
choose to reside here in Waterdeep's most lavish and elegant ward.

The homes which line both sides of the street are built as much for
practicality as they are for show.  Windows facing west are heavily
barred and some are double and triple paned due to the fierce sea
storms which blow in during the winter months.  Truly important, and
sometimes self-important, people come here to build their homes,
despite the limited months at which this ward is hospitable.  The Sea
Ward has for them a special allure of wealth and power.  Diamond

Lavish temples lie scattered about, some built before this street
was established.  Each follows its own unique architectural style, and
many sects established throughout the realms model their churches
after these built in the City of Splendors.  The street itself does
not match any single temple style, but it does match the feeling of
reverence, paved here in dark onyx, which is kept very clean.

You have stumbled into a peaceful, fragrant grove surrounded by
deep forest, and carpeted in thick, lush grass.  A waterfall cascades
from a rock ledge to the north, and empties into a quiet pool in which
many rainbow-colored fish feed.  Next to the pool a massive weeping
willow trails its long, sinuous fingers in the water.  Large
iridescent-blue fruit hang heavily from a silver-barked tree nestled
in boulders.  Sunlight streams through the thick canopy of trees,
spilling across the low, comfortable grass hassocks scattered about. 
Exotic flowers of all shapes and sizes color the grove and send rich
perfume wafting throughout, while many-colored butterflies dance among
them.  A variety of wide-eyed rabbits, deer, and other creatures move
about, watching you inquisitively, yet unafraid.

Singing Dolphin ends here, as it meets up with the trollwall to the
north.  To the east begins Skulls Street, named for the time when
troll invasions brought much bloodshed to this area.  Remnants of
those great battles still remain, as the great Trolltower rises to the
north, and further out past the city walls is a heavily fortified
unofficial gate into the city, known as the Trollfort.  A lowly tavern
lies just off the street, but otherwise the buildings here are rather
plain and function, at least for this high profile district of the
City.

The wide street opens to an intersection where many people
congregate.  To the north and south, Diamond Street runs in a
distinctive paving of white stone.  Further to the north, Diamond
Street opens into a park, seemingly very popular as many people gather
and walk about it.  Many high, stylish structures have been erected in
this ward of the city, mostly religious in nature, but some placed as
inspirational art pieces, most during the time of Waterdeep's cultural
renaissance.  This avenue is distinctive in the many statuettes and
symbolic sculptures which line the sidewalks, as every religion fights
for their own recognition.

The main street veers north as it encounters a beautiful tower just
to the west, while heading due east further into the city.  The west
tower is a spiraling form, reminiscent of the luck trinkets children
wear about their necks.  A wall lies to the west, elegantly adorned
with coin-shaped bricks, and fading, metallic foil that once brought
luster to the masonry.  To the south, Sul Street begins, leading down
here to the main bazaar of Waterdeep.  The street begins clean and
ornate, and transforms into a utilitarian slab where commerce and
traffic ensues.

Delzorin curves an S as it meanders through the densely populated
temple district.  Lavish temples lie scattered about, some built
before this street was established.  Each follows its own unique
architectural style, and many sects established throughout the realms
model their churches after these built in the City of Splendors.  The
street itself does not match any single temple style, but it does
match the feeling of reverence, paved here in dark onyx, which is
cleaned and polished daily by the order of thralls.

Small puddles gather in and around the road, as the sea brings in
frequent rain to the dismay, and sometimes joy of Waterdhavens.  The
sloping street suggests its age, where low and high spots build due to
probably centuries of use and abuse.  Temples, regarded for their
beauty, use highly ornate waterspouts to push the rain onto the
street, preserving its own heritage while trodding on its main artery.
Many elaborate religious symbols can be seen lining the walls of
almost every villa and building that one passes through this ward.

This street is well kept, despite heavy traffic.  The stones are
cut slabs, worn smooth from daily use, deeply set as suggested by the
dark crevases that form between them.  Delzorin is frequented more by
those who make their pilgrimages to the nearby temples and shrines. 
The lack of trade and commerce here results in a much cleaner part of
the city, and the magnificent temple architectures give this ward an
allure of inspiration.  Delzorin continues east and west, and just
east of here opens the busy High Road.

All around are tall ornate walls and the richly spired buildings that
sit behind them, just out of reach from anyone who is not a member of
the right guild, or who knows the right kind of people to gain access
to them. They look as inaccessible also with not a smear of a child's
hand marring the bright marble surfaces, or the lackluster appearance
of an inviting bench for citizens to rest awhile. Many of these walls
hole away the homes of nobility which in turn hide clandestine guilds
that one either has to be born into or spend many years in service of
in order to even get a glimpse at what happens behind them shut doors.

The likes of the High Road stretches on as far as the eye can see both
north and south of here. To the east of the road are many stone, brick
and marble mansions, each in competition with the other for the status
of being the tallest and most obscenely gaudy building in the ward. To
this end, many display wrought iron spires that appear as precariously
balanced as they are expensive to erect and maintain. Some manors have
extravagant entrances and lush gardens that display exotic plants from
all over the realms. Others are near overwhelmed with statues and rich
stonework balanced by incredible architectural feats beyond their time.{x

The northern gates of Waterdeep City rise just north of a cobblestoned
avenue that runs straight through the city. This is the High Road--the
long trade route that any seasoned merchant knows by heart. It is here,
grooved deep in places from centuries of heavy traffic, and frequently
repaired with smooth stones excavated along the nearby sea. Here along
the way intersects a smaller street, named Skull to the west and Immar
to the east, as indicated by a nearby marker post. Several individuals

The smooth cobblestone avenue gets as much care as it does use judging
by its quality. In several places new lighter-colored stones have been
added to repair the damage set on from continual use. Along both sides
of the High Road stretch many brick and wood buildings unlike anywhere
else in the region, as brick is an expensive material to build with in
most parts. Many of these buildings are manor houses with their ornate
eaves and lush garden gateways many accented with noble lords in front
garbed in brightly colored robes over pale white skin. Many stand idle
as their gardeners and servants tend to the garden and walk about them.{x

Trollwall--the ancient stone wall built to fend off trolls in the
ancient time of Waterdeep's history.  Along with the feeling of dark
and emptyness, this road is quite literally dark: fashioned from large
squares of black stone, which have been rounded at the junctions from
many centuries of foot traffic.  Buildings line the southern edge, and
lie scattered at the north, squeezed between the road and the wall. 
Many are homes belonging to Waterdeep's watch.  Skulls Street

Skulls Street meets up with the northern wall of Waterdeep--this
area known affectionately as the Trollkill Walk.  Heavily fortified,
the trollwall here shows signs of an ancient moss covered base, upon
which is built countless levels of different stones spanning different
eras from which this wall was breached and repaired.  Today, little
threat remains of troll invasions, though the city guard maintains
their posts here and around the north walls, where tall guard towers
were erected to maintain peace.  The buildings which line this street
are tall, two story juggernauts which overtake the small plots that
each are built upon.  For many years following Waterdeep's turmoil
with the trolls, these plots were next to worthless--today they are
among the most sought after locales for anyone, as this area has
become an upper scale part of Waterdhaven society.

This street is wider than many of the offshoot runs, though not as
wide as some of Waterdeep's main travel arteries.  The stones here are
wide flatstone, mined from the nearby river and seashore.  It is a
rugged stone, darker than river stone from other regions, and most are
very flat, offering strength, convenience, and a character all its
own.  Along both sides of the street, the grand villas of the north
ward stand.  Unlike most other homes in Waterdeep, these villas are
spacious.  Alleyways are scarce, as special provisions have allowed
the nobles to take over these for their own use.  Such uses include
gardens, courts, or just a place to put up a privacy wall, which one
will find plenty of here.

round.  To the east the street intersects with another.  North and
south are elegant villas of the noble class of Waterdeep.

Delzorin Street continues east and west, through the wealthy
neighborhoods of nobility.  The villas which lie on either side of the
street are grand displays of wealth, and could house a dozen or more
people comfortably within, yet more commonly 3 or less inhabit them,
as a testament to what money can buy even in a city straining for
every pinch of space it can muster.  A grand mansion lies to the
north, while to the south is a shop with many extravagant pieces of
armor and weaponry on display in the window.

Suldown makes a sharp turn here, as it traverses several old
buildings that resided here when the street was just a cutthrough. 
The street is narrow, and there is scarcely a sidewalk to traverse, as
people walk out among the carts and beasts that travel much slower
than the likes of Dolphin or the High Road, making such a move safe. 
Along the northern half of the street are quaint apartments and half
villas, rented and owned by the lesser nobility, though still a castle
to a commoner.  The windows facing southward are few, and those that
exist are shaded and kept shut.  Along the southern edge is a wall
adorned with bones and skulls, black iron and aged timbers.  A wall
barring two worlds, and segregating the mystery that is death to the
innocence of the city.

Delzorin Street ends here at a T-intersection, which opens in a
large circle.  A smaller street called Whaelgond runs north and south.
Here at the end of the street stands a great mansion, spanning
multiple city lots and rising several stories which are hard to count
due to the inconsistency of windows that are spaced about its odd
angles.  The mansion offers a direct line of sight down Delzorin for
its residence, as far as the temples of the sea ward far to the west
and beyond.  Across massive, closed gates and a lush garden walkway
sits a mansion shrouded in secrecy--just one of the many places of
intrigue here in the north ward of Waterdeep.

The small street known as Whaelgond runs north and south straight
through the middle of some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in all of
Waterdeep.  Here, the villas turn their backs to the street,
preferring to display their showy entryways to main stretches such as
Delzorin to the north, where most of the traffic passes.  To the west
is the side of a shop, which contrasts with the decorative features of
the homes, preferring function over form.  Yet even the modest of
shops here in the north ward is a castle compared to those seen
elsewhere in the city, especially in the likes of the dock ward.

The distinction between the meeting of two streets is blurred here
in this makeshift commons, as Saerdown Street runs southward, and
Immar northward.  Here, several of the homes lie staggered along the
road, some opening to the adjacent streets on the other side of the
block, but whichever end one looks at these villas, they remain
striking in their design.  Many display large spires which seem to
fight one another for the highest position, and most all are adorned
with ironwork and stonework representing among the highest quality
anywhere.  Just south of here begins the cliffwatch.

as the Trollwall begins here to the north, circumventing near the
whole of the City of Spendors.  Here to the south is the cliffwatch--a
break in the city walls marked by a 100 foot dropoff where no wall is
needed.  Opening to the east is a beautiful view of the countryside.

Two streets meet here: Sulmor which starts here and runs westward,
and Saerdown which follows the cliffwatch north and south.  Beautiful
homes line both sides of the street, their style distinctive to the
traditional styles of the city.  These are the homes of nobility, who
take up residence here in the north ward.  While the nobility class of
Waterdeep live elsewhere, most established families stay in this
district, known to be the safest, cleanest and wealthiest next to the
palace and castle grounds of course.  And here one gets a rare glimpse
of beauty from all fronts--the lavish villas and a breathtaking view
of the countryside to the east.

Whaelgond Way continues north and south.  The sewer covers here are
rounded and shaped like wagon wheels--a favorite symbol of the god of
craft.  This ancient alleyway turned street was once the established
locale for some of Waterdeeps early coachmakers, though the trollwars
turned it into a vast warehouse district where seige engines were
constructed.  In modern days, the builders moved further south to be
closer to the docks where their building materials now come in. 
Coachmakers to the south, and enginecraft to the southwest, the locale
has changed, but the craft remains the same.  To the west a quaint
pastry shop is opened up.

begins Whaelgond Way--a small cutthrough connecting Suldown with other
parallel stretches to the north.  A few dark, one storied buildings
reside along the southern stretch of lots, which are narrow and
restricted by the impending walls of the City of the Dead.  The
graveyard, constructed centuries ago to combat the growing need for a
burial ground safe from heathen arts, is now a quiet park where
citizens can go, but city ordinance forbids strolling there after
hours.

The beautiful villas enclose this wide circle as Sulmor Street
gently intersects with Wheelgond to the north and south.  Each of
these homes are very old, and lavishly decorated, with tall iron gates
and front gardens that take up near as much space as the homes
themselves.  Only in the North Ward would such an obscene waste of
precious space be tolerated, though here if one is a noble, near
anything is tolerated.

This small shop smells distinctly of fish.  The walls and floors here
creak and moan almost on their own will - most likely due to age and

bought.  The store isn't very clean, but it's what one would expect from an

The streets are relatively quiet in this district, unlike the rest
of the city where day or night there are things happening.  Faint
music can be heard from an open window of one of the many lavish
villas which line both sides of Sulmor Street.  It is accompanied by
the sounds of laughter and conversation--most likely a party and one
that has a very exclusive guest list.  A few people walk the streets,
a cart and some horses, but otherwise traffic here is light.  In fact,
using these residential runs is regulated, no by Waterdeep code, but
by the gold coins which the nobles line the city watch's pockets with,
to ensure peace and quiet.  Strangers and would be trouble makers are
frowned upon here, and scarcely do they get far without questioning.

Standing at the cast iron gates of Waterdeep, the northern plains call
out as the wind blows the tall grass and brings up the occasional dust
cloud from the dirt road that merges into Waterdeep City--the famously
vast High Road of song and lore. To the south stand majestic buildings
fit for kings in some lands but are merely noble manors in a city such
as this. The occasional cart or wagon can be seen entering and exiting
the city, some filled to the top and strapped about with trading goods
while others sparsely loaded down as it embarks on the quest back home
after a successful day at the Market Bazaar, in the center of the City.{x

Sea Ward.  The rather plain buildings which line Julthoon and the
bazaar slowly morph into elegant masterworks of architecture, with
fleured eaves and elaborate waterspouts.  These are the characteristic
temple architecture prevalent in this ward, whether it is religious or

Sul Street continues through the heart of the Sea Ward, passing by
many well regarded places, mostly temples and villas, though the
occasional guildhall or political building passes by, reminding
Waterdhavens of the cogs upon which the city runs.  Sul is a modestly
laid out street, paved of simple mortarless red brick, patterned in
repeats of elbow turns.  The splendor of its surroundings upgrades its
otherwise ordinary appearance, making it blend in seamlessly with the
rest of the ward.  To the north, Delzorin begins, while to the south,
Sul intersects with its sister street Sulmor.

border with the walls surrounding the City of the Dead to the south. 
Here, the styles are clean and traditional: stone and iron makes up
much of the storefronts, while the simple structures between this
street and the dead city are nearly formless in design.  Few stores do
business along this stretch, preferring instead places where people
would actually enjoy stopping and letting go of a few coins.  Smaller
homes and apartments line the northern half of the street, entering
into the grander showcase of noble villas further northward.
