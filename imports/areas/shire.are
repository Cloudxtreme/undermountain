oldstyle elven wizard~
the Elven Wizard~
An Elven Wizard is here, creating fireworks for the festivities.
~
The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems to
penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak
and holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older
than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
cannot overcome.

the Keeper of the Ring~
The Keeper of the Ring is here, guarding his treasure jealously.
~
The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short halfling.  His short stature and
bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
usually a halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
to take away that which belongs to him.

Shiriff Post of Delving Lane~
~
You are in the Shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs
of Delving Lane.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
awe.  The only exit is to the west.

All around large trees grow, all different kinds.  They stand tall,
creating a somewhat thick canopy overhead.  Inside the forest, the
sounds of life echo as its habitants go on with their daily lives.  A
small dirt path, probably an animal trail, cuts through the forest
floor.
