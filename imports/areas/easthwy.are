Western Gates of Soubar~
~
The trail leads you to the western gates of the town of Soubar. 
This bustling town has a large marketplace, much of it for the crops
that are raised in the farmsteads around Soubar.  Most of the small
wooden houses in Soubar are tightly packed together, but a fair amount
also have brick chimneys and porches.

Southern Gates of Treil~
~
The southern gates of Treil stand ungaurd, as did the gates of its
sister town Soubar.  A few riders, mounted on quick riding horses
thunder past you to the south, obviously in quite a hurry.  Farmers
and carts with farm goods and implements can be seen still just about
everywhere.

As you enter the wood, darkness surrounds you.  Having just been in
bright sunlight, you suddenly feel blind.  Strange bird calls echo
throughout the forest, and you can hear the scuffling of animal noises
around you.  You notice a dim light ahead, piercing through the
darkness of the wood.

The brush starts to thin, replaced by a few small bushes and trees.
Beyond this vegitation, the brown open earth stretches to the distant
pines on the mountain's edge.  A few more boulders lie in the near

As your path has continued its northeast direction, the mountains
to your north have dipped further southward.  They stand a few hundred
miles off.  You can now make out their individual peaks and snowcapped
summits.  Its also now possible to realize the full extent of their
staggering height, which stretches upward toward the sky as if they

BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!  A
tremendous cracking sound as loud as thunder makes your ears ring. 
The earth shudders as a huge boulder lands just a few feet in front of
you.  In a few seconds another boulder whizzes overhead and lands with
a crash in the distance.  You'd better get out of here while you still
can.  But what the heck is going on?

You stand before the mountain town of High Horn.  High stone walls
surround the town, long barbs protruding from the top of the walls. 
Every so often a tower rises up from the barbs, and several lookouts
wielding sharp halberds can be seen from within them.  The surrounding
area must be dangerous for a town to have such defenses.

The town of High Horn is fairly large, but very compact.  Houses
are small, and built close to one another, likely for protection.  The
streets are heavily guarded, and watch towers dot the city.  There are
large lumber and mining industries in High Horn, and the city is
crowded with lumberjacks and miners buying goods.

High Horn stands on your west, the lights of the city give a cozy
feeling compared to the marked darkness around you as you stand in the
shadow of the mountains to the north.  Fortunately the highway leads
southeast, away from the northern High Horn Mountains.  From the

volume of traffic on the eastern side of High Horn.

The land climbs steadily upwards.  Unlike the Storm Horn Mountains,
the Thunder Peaks are a string of tall individual mountains.  From
where you stand you can see very few cliffs or cravasses, the
foothills run up to the mountain forests which slope steeply upward
until the treeline clears on each of the mountains.  You can now tell
that there is quite a distance inbetween the towering Thunder Peaks.

Approaching Tilverton~

To the north is the town of Tilverton, which stands within the
natural cradle of the Thunder Peaks.  The eastern highway runs through
Tilverton, then forks into two seperate pieces.  The northern piece of
the highway runs north then east between the highest of the peaks. 
The eastern section of the highway runs through a larger natural break
between the mountains, too big to be a valley.  The chain of mountains
resumes further south and east from this opening.

Tilverton stands here.  Although a mountain town, much influence
has come from expanses of the western deserts and Tilverton has a
great population of arab-like people.  Water is a particularly
important traded commoditity here, as people that plan to cross the
desert must take a great stock of it with them.

they are not nearly so rugged or unexplored as the Storm Horns to the

The roadway follows a wide path cleared in the wooded area of
trees.  The pine trees that surround the highway seem to be ancient,
very large, and very grotesque.  Branches twist about as they reach up
toward the sky, groping for light in the dense wood.  Only a short
distance can be seen past the first row of trees, they're so thick
that there's bearly any walking distance between them.

them.  Although odd, the trees don't seem malicious or menacing.

balding white hair atop his head staring at you.  The mountain,
although almost mournful, does not seem in the least bit unfriendly or
uninviting.  These mountains would be a wonderful place to go to get
away from the rest of world.  Not a creature or another living being

great forest sprawl out in virtually all directions.  Open plains
extends some distance directly eastward from where you now stand
before the forest engulfs it in the distant east.  Unlike the pine
trees around you, the forested land to the east appears to be composed
of many leafy trees, although the type is unrecognizable to you from

Eastern Highway~

The roadway turns east here into some woods.  Although not
particularly dense, these woods have quite a bit of underbrush.  Some
of this hangs over the highway, making it narrower than it should be. 
Several plants of poison ivy also hang over into the road.  Be
careful, or you'll touch their leaves.

More poison ivy and thistle grows along the road here, thriving in
the woods.  A few strange birds scream out, causing quite a racket. 
Although they sound extremely odd, you can't seem to actually see one
of these birds, no matter how hard you look.  A few robins hop around
the forest floor, busily looking for worms.

You continue down the forest road, heading northeast.  Its
suprisingly cool underneath the trees for how brightly the sun is
shining overhead.  Much of the sunlight is not blocked by leaves and
illuminates your surroundings quite well.  A light breeze blows across
your face and rustles the leaves overhead.

The roadway turns sharply east here, heading into a thicker grove
of trees and bushes.  The ground is a bit soggy, suggesting that it
has recently rained in this area.  A large green toad sits a few feet
from the road's edge, staring at you.

You hear the sound of running water to the east, yet the forest
obscures your view so that you can't see the source of the sound.  The
road declines a bit, heading down a hill in the forest.  A few more
thorn bushes grow off to the side of the road, inviting travelers to
get stuck on their thorns.

Crossing the Ashaba River~
~
The sound of rushing water is very loud here.  The Ashaba River
runs before the road, a rickety old wooden bridge crosses it.  A few
of the planks are noticably rotten and cracked.  It wouldn't be
pleasent to fall into the swift waters below, or the jagged rocks that
are scattered throughout the narrow riverbed.

The sound of water can still be heard here from the Ashaba River
off to the south.  Mosquitoes are thick here, the little bloodsuckers
land all over your face and neck trying to gorge themselves on your
blood.  There must be standing water around here somewhere.

Peach trees stand here in rows, their branches drooping from the
loads of fruit that they carry.  Several ladders are pearched against
the sides of the trees, with half filled baskets of ripe peaches below
them.  The air is saturated with the smell of ripe fruit, and a
variety of bees and other insects buzz around your ears.

Pathway to the Shire of Shadowdale~
~
The forest ends here abruptly.  The road continues north towards
the town of Shadowdale.  Several houses can be seen off to the
northeast, however their windows and doors are boarded up, and several
holes can be seen in the roofs even from this distance.  No trees
stand to the north, although a few blackened stumps still poke through
the ground.

A Forest Road~
~
Up ahead you can see a clearing in the woods.  The roadway leads up
to what appears to be a bridge that crosses a carefully made
courtyard.  As the trees end, the sun shines so brightly that it takes
a few minutes of blinking for your eyes to adjust to the bright light.
It looks like this is the last outpost where travelers can rest and
recover before heading into the Drannor Forest.
