A beaten slave~
A beaten human slave lies here crumpled in the floor
~
The human on the floor doesn't even look at you as you walk into his cell. The pitiful creature does not even try to escape. His will is broken and he is resigned to the inevitable.

A Narrow Hallway~
~
This narrow hallway is completely devoid of any detail, a bleak
place indeed.  You can smell the stench of poor waste removal as if it
permeates the very rock.  The hallway is reasonably lit, but the
lights seem to grow dimmer as you continue.  What a foul place this
would be if one were a guest.

A Prison Hallway~
~
This hallway leads down a row of cells, where slaves are held until
they make thier way to thier new home.  The passageway is very narrow
and the cells are close together, showing they are probably very
small.  The veins of the prison are barely lit, but it is still almost
pitch dark.

A Narrow Hallway~
~
This narrow hallway is completely devoid of any detail, a bleak
place indeed.  You can smell the stench of poor waste removal as if it
permeates the very rock.  The hallway is reasonably lit, but the
lights seem to grow dimmer as you continue.  What a foul place this
would be if one were a guest.

A Prison Hallway~
~
This hallway leads down a row of cells, where slaves are held until
they make thier way to thier new home.  The passageway is very narrow
and the cells are close together, showing they are probably very
small.  The veins of the prison are barely lit, but it is still almost
pitch dark.

A Dungeon Cell~
~
The cell is too small for the occupants, barely large enough to lie
down in.  The stone walls are mildewed and dank.  The smell of feces
and urine permeate the walls, as there are no facilities for the
slaves kept here.

A Narrow Hallway~
~
This narrow hallway is completely devoid of any detail, a bleak
place indeed.  You can smell the stench of poor waste removal as if it
permeates the very rock.  The hallway is reasonably lit, but the
lights seem to grow dimmer as you continue.  What a foul place this
would be if one were a guest.
