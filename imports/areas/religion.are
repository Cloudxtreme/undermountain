It all depends on me, you see. Nothing is certain until I have beheld it and set it in place, until I have placed myself above it or below, before or after.

It depends on me of course, everything does.
Who shall live. Who shall die. What is, what shall be.
Imagine I am watching from above, hovering in the sky as mortals
are wont to thinkwe gods do. The vast sea lies below, forever slapping 
at the rocky shore of the Sword Coast, where Candlekeep's towers of 
profane ignorance sit upon the pedistal of a black basalt tor. With a breath
I could blast that bastion of falsity down, powder the mortar between its
stones and send its high walls crashing into the sea, scatter its twisted
tomes to the bubbling mires and the deep stinking oceans int he far corners
of the world...

All blessings and strength upon his Church and his Servants, who alone shall rule over the Kingdom of mortals and dwell forever in the Palace of Eternity in the time beyond the Year of Carnage.

incredible charms.  Her symbol is her fac, that of a flame haired maiden. 
Sune is of chaotic and good alignment, and dwells in the plane of Arvandor,
home of the Elven Pantheon.  She is said to share the waters elven goddess
Hanali Celanil, and a friendly rivalry exists between the two over the
innate superiority of elven versus human beauty.  /s

  Welcome to the Waterdeep Immortal Handbook.  This boolet will tell you
how you really should handle cases with mortals.  In recent times we have
been having trouble with the handling of mortals and rules.  This boolet

                       [Page 2] Pulling Over An Mortal
Whenever you must call upon a mortal for some reason, a rule breakage or a
report, anything "offical" that goes with the rules, you are to pull the
mortal over to either Room 69 or your private chambers.  Mortals have the
RIGHT to see which immortal has pulled them over, and they may wish to ask,
we ask that you be visable to the mortal, and face them face to face.  Talk
to the mortal like a person, and work out your problem.  If the mortal isn't
behaving, warn him several times that if he/she does not calm down, you will
corner them, or slay them.  If they refuse or just continue, then they show
that they do not care about Waterdeep.  Either corner them for the rule, or
take care of the problem.  If the mortal tells all and acts like a good player
should, being cooperative with you, and you being cooperative back, then
deal with the case.  No matter what, if the mortal has broken a rule, you are
to punish them based on several factors.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
~
E
page3~
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                             [Page 3] Punishment
Waterdeep has a punishment system setup, called the Plevel Factor.  Each
level which is defined in HELP PUNISHMENT defines what kind of punishment
you may give to a mortal.  You are also to check their P-RECORD to see if
they have any previous records of breaking this rule, or anything close to
it.  Based upon their P-Record you punish according to offenses.  If they
have no previous offenses of that rule, then it is their first.  Also if
the player is very helpful during the time being, a person with a clean
pboard can just get a warning.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
~
E
page4~
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                         [Page 4] Harsher Punishments
There is several more types of punishment besides the Plevels.  These go into
the categories of "slay, wipe, ban".  If you slay a mortal, you are to hold
onto their EQ, in case there is trouble with the mortal.  If for some reason
the mortal was found to be wronged by the immortal, the Eq can be given back.
If they do not say anything after at least 24 hours, then you may destroy the
EQ.  Wiping is only for high authority immortals.  Each wipe is to be penalized
in the penal board.  Banning is only done by the higher immortals, DO NOT USE
A FULL BAN!! ONLY A NEWBIE LOCK!!.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
~
E
page5~
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                            [Page 5] End The Case
Once you have your mortal punished and you are finished, you most document
this event using the PBOARD.  Type PBOARD to see the options.  Due to the
newer rule system, to pboard with the sub-rules, you may need to do something
like:
pboard new NAME RULE SUBRULE-PUNISHMENT
You place the Sub-Rule Letter and then the punishment, using the same
slot for both things.  Like C-Warned for breaking sub-rule C, and the
person got a warning.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
~
E
page6~
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                              [Page 6] Banning
Banning is only for high authority immortals.  When you ban, do not put a full
ban on a site unless truely needed.  Use a Newbie Lock.  Any ban is to be
documented in the Pboard record.  You can use the "name" slot to contain the
site name, so when you research it, you will find the site name, rule breakage
and date.

                            [Page 7] Cheat Sheet
======================
Pulling Over A Mortal:
Transfer them to a private room --> Tell them what they did wrong
--> if they wish to see you, go visable --> tell them again their

their pboard and help punishment --> pboard the case.
 
======================
Banning A Site:

This temple seems more like a legal courtroom.  A large statue
of Tyr stands behind an altar that is very reminiscent of a judge's
bench.  The statue holds a scale.  On one side of the scale sits a
sun and the other a moon.  The ceiling features a skylight that
reveals a bright sky.

is covered in black, the walls as dark as night, no windows or lights
glowing.  Large, iron pillars reach up from the ground, holding the
roof above, which is invisible in this darkness.  In between the iron
pillars can be seen a person's nightmares, their worst thoughts.  By
the north wall, a large black alter floats in space.

Spot In The Sun~
~
Here is a lovely spot in the park, perpetually warmed by the sun.
Trees stand all around and park benches hold lovers in each others'
arms.  A merchant has set up shop here, selling useful objects.  The
edge of a quaint little pond is just to the west, while River Street
can be found to the north.  Off to the side is a dark passageway
down into the ground nearly completely covered over with spiderwebs.

Temple Of Cyric~
~
Lies. Death. Murder. It all lies within these black marble walls.
The room is very dark. The only light comes from the candles on
the altar. All that is visible is the altar and a statue of Cyric
behind it.

Temple Of Chauntea~
~
Hemp-bound books line the wall and a multitude of plants grow all
over the place.  The temple is reminiscent of a greenhouse. Farmers
sit in here, reading on the weather and talking about this year's
harvest. An altar made of hemp stands here, with a statue of Chauntea
behind it.

Temple Of Lathander~
~
The smell of spring is in the air.  The picture of a rising sun
can be seen behind the altar, where a statue of Lathander stands. 
Pregnant women often visit the temple, seeking the blessing of
Lathander and assistance from the priests of the temple.  Several
spring creatures peek about the rows of pews.

Temple Of Mystra~
~
The pillars in the temple crackle with the sound of electricity
as a bolt of lightning jumps from one pillar to the next. The walls
are filled with books... spell books.  Many mages, wizards and
clerics visit here, studying spells and worshipping Mystra, the
embodiment of magic itself.

Temple Of Oghma~
~
This is a very large library. Books of inventions stand all around
on shelves.  There are several old men working on a strange device. It
looks like a small ship, with a balloon attached and small engines
with blades.  There is an altar, cluttered with junk, with a statue
of Oghma behind it.

Temple Of Shar~
~
The temple seems to be as dark as night and there is a pervasive
aura of loss.  An awful presence of darkness and night fills the
building.  There is a black altar with a statue of Shar behind
it.  All is emptiness.

Temple Of Silvanus~
~
Nature thrives in this temple. Wild nature. All kinds of wild
beasts sit in this temple, looking at each other, looking very hungry.
They would eat each other if not for the presence of Silvanus here.
The altar is made from hard wood and so is the statue of Silvanus
behind it.

Temple Of Talos~
~
A lightning bolts strikes down. The temple is filled with
destruction. Winds in the room seem to feel like a hurricane.
A large tornado spins in the middle of the room. The walls seem
to be burning with rage.

Only a very dim candle spreads light in this underground temple.
The walls are covered with spider webs that hold some very large
spiders.  There are a few large lizards sleeping in the corner of
the temple.  An altar with blood on it sits in front of a statue
of Lloth, The Spider Queen, Ruler Of The Underdark.
