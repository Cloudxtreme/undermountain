constantly shifting.  It's orb shaped eyes gleam with intelligence as
it scans the room looking for intruders.

{$Looking Upon a Sylvan Forest{0
 After coming out of the locked door to the south, the cave opened up to a
prosperous forest which stands before you now.  The sun shines brightly in
the clear blue sky.  Songbirds fill the area with calm and relaxing music. 
And critters of all sorts, chipmunks, rabbits, squirrels, can be seen
running along with their daily chores.  To the north, you can make out a
small trail.  By the looks of how it is overgrown, brings you to believe
that this trail has not been used by many in the past years.

Entrance to a {8Dark {$Foreboding Cave{0~
~
As you clear through the thickets of branches and vines, your vision
shows you a dark opening into a huge cave.  You sense a great power
eminating from it, making you feel uneasy.  North leads into the strange
magical darkness of the cave and south back into the woods from where you
came.

Just inside the Cave~
~
As you enter the cavern, the feeling of power become stronger and you can
almost make out textures or patterns in the air that are slowly becoming
misty.  Glancing around as the mist thickens you quickly make out four
symbols - Earth, Air , Fire, and Water - and the mist then encompasses your
sight.  A faint glowing light can be seen from what appears to be north to
you, and to your back, south, is the exit out into the woods again.

Small Naturally Made Room~
~
You make your way past the mist as a cool wave of air overcomes you. 
Looking around you see the coarse and jagged stone of the natural made
cavern floor starting to protrude small stalagmites and the ceiling as well
with stalactites.  To the east and west, two large wooden doors, cracked and
settled with age, hold tight to their poorly made frames.  To the North the
cave continues, and South is back to the mist

Stalagmites and Stalactites~
~
The ceiling and floor here is growing with numerous stalactites and
stalagmites that have probably been forming for many decades.  An occasional
drip echoes the cavern here as some calcium liquid drips from the
stalactites above.  A narrow staircase has been carved into the rock of the
west wall leading upward.

endlessly around you.  The puddles seem to be getting bigger leading toward

fine...  To the north and south you can see the whirlpools twisting and
turning with a very strong current...  But to the north you see something
shining, like an object sticking out of the water.  To your east is a door
and west is back to the pillars

Water sprays and hits your whole body as you enter this place!  Before
you stands a great Waterworld.  The north, east, and west walls are half
crumbled as a waterfall spashes out of all three directions!  The water
collects in the center of the room into a small pool of water that goes
quite deep.  You notice a doorway to the north behind the waterfall , and a
cavelike opening can be seen behind the east and west waterfalls.

Flowing Lava~

Bubbling and boiling right below your feet is a large pool of lava.  The

lava has eaten away at it, leaving just a crumbling mess of probably a once
wide walkway.

Ore Cart Nexus~
~
As you squeeze through the small hole from back south you notice a huge
open area.  A crisscross of lines brings together many mining rails here. 
Many of them have old broken down ore carts upon them, while the rails look
a bit rusty.  Shovels and picks litter the floors here as if a bunch of old
dwarves just abandoned the area with immediate haste.  You hear a loud
scream echo throughout the nexus....  You cant seem to place the direction
of it.  
To the west is an ore cart lined on the tracks. The rail dips almost straight down. To the north and east are rails tracks as well, both leading into darkness.

Ore Cart Ride~
~
A well kept ore cart is here lined up with the rail tracks and still
quite useable.  Looking westward you see that the cave closes in and the
railtrack exits into a small hole only big enough to fit an ore cart.  The
track that leads west stays level with your sight for a few feet and then
dips straight down into the hole.

You decide to take a little adventure, knowing very well that the tracks
could be broken ahead and lead you to a plunging death into a bath of molten
lava where your flesh would melt and your eyeballs turn into mush...  But
anyway!  You feel lucky!  So you hop on into the ore cart, which is the only
access to enter the hole, and tuck yourself inside after you give it a
little push.

Approaching a Cliffside~

The stream flows on east to some huge sized boulders that ends the
surrounding cave to a cliff.  You creep up to the boulders and take a look
down below to see that the magma pours straight down from here in the form
of a great waterfall!  Below, te magma gathers in a small pool and slowly
trickles on further east and out of your view.  Also, as you look, something
below catches your eye....  It seemed to have ran toward the magma waterfall
and is now out of your sight.  
Down leads along a steep and rocky path which leads to the pool of magma below

Travelling along side the Waterfall~
~
You descend down the very steep path, tripping over a few stones here and
there.  You can recall losing your balance one or twice as well, but caught
yourself before you fell below into the hot bath of molten lava.  The magma
that flows just beside you is giving off a tremendous amount of heat and you
feel your stamina giving in.  The rocky path continues on down, still quite
close to the magma

is wet from sweat.  Even now, as you take a breath, the heat surrounds you,
making it hard to breath and stay cool.  Not far to the west you can see the
pool of magma.

Just when you thought you could not get any hotter, you clear through
some tropical plants and see a a pool of magma, giving off more heat than
you have ever been around.  Just to the west you can see the splashing of
magma fly everywhere where the 'lavafall' meets the pool.  Hmmmm, once again
you see something over by that 'lavafall' , but with a blink of your eyes it
is gone.

You stand before a gorgeuos fall of magma.  It shimmers and glows from
the heat intensity building up inside of it.  A bit of mamgma splashes out
from the pool and plops beside your foot.  Searching around the fall, you
notice a bit of space behind the falling magma and you see that 'something'
moving...  But it quiclky disappears in an instant once again.  After
looking around you notice the only way behind that fall is through the magma
itself...

Behind the Fall of Magma~

It is extremely humid in here.  It seems that much heat and moisture is
captured behind the magma here.  You can't see much, except for the numerous
markings that symbolize {1Fire{0.  To the west you hear something.  Most
likely this same 'thing' you've been seeing lurking around the pool of
magma.

You descend deeper down into the {6cold {$blue{0 waters.  This place
reminds you of a barren desert in a way.  No matter which way you go, water
is the only thing you see everywhere - no fishes, no stone markings, no
plants..  Nothing.

In the Oceanic Deep~
~
You have somehow made it down to the depths of the Oceanic Abyss.  Light
does not penetrate here, not even a tiny fragment.  The water is extremely
cold, and you can feel your skin numbing and notice how it is starting to
turn blue.  There are no plants to be seen at this depth for the cold is too
much for them to bear.  In fact, all you see here is deep coral and massive
stones that probably equal out to the sizes of houses in the above world. 
Hmm, well there is one thing you notice shining in the corner under one of
those stones...  It's a giant Mollusk!

~
The hallway here is much different from the passageway to the south.  The
walls are made out of marble here, and very clean cut.  As you check the
surrounding walls you almost stumble into a pit below , which is too dark
inside to see anything.  A small ledge on the left will make your travel
across much safer...

Corridor of Currents~

You have entered the magical hallways of {^Water{0.  A thick piece of
glass lines the walls here holding vast amounts of water behind them.  Lucky

You reach the top of the tower and enter dark room.  The only light are
the ocasional candles along the walls and a few torchs around a table that
is stacked with books and scrolls.  The thin slit windows allow little light
to enter.  The walls are covered with bookshelves and parchments racks.  On
some of the shelves are potions and varios jars of ingredents.  This appears
the be the main room for where someone would practice learn and perfect
magics that could heal, or in your case for disturbing, ...  Harm.

Up above you lies the door to Air Elemental. A strong gust of wind swoops down from the west, taking you by surprise and pushes you east a bit.
An awsome power can be felt here, much like the doors leading to the Water And Fire elementals.

Dark, cold, misty...  The woods around you seem endless.  The heavy mist

Your eyesight becomes clouded from a thick mist that envelops this part
of the woods.  Not a single ray of light penetrates through the high, bushy
trees, or ther thick heavy mist.  A soft cold breeze blows by and gives you
the chills and a crow starts to caw loudly to the north east.

Focus of Water~
~
It feels as if nothing stands between you and the open plane of water
along this tunnel.  The strange sensation of walking in a long, crystal tube
is mystifying, yet slightly frightening.  It is as if the tunnel itself was
just waiting to collapse in on you, snuffing the very life from your body. 
Yet, strangely, the tunnel holds strong.  And nothing prevents you from
going further.

This room has smooth stone walls striped with different layers
of sediment.  The floor is of a polished stone that gleams in
the light of the torches along the walls.  Golems of the
elements stand guard along the walls, their eyes all trained
on one central golem that shifts between the elements.
