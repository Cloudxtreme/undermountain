A small, hidden library room~
~
This small room is filled with books, most of which are rare or one
of a kind.  The room is illuminated by several enchanted candles, made
to produce light without a risk of burning any books.  In the corner
is a large, soft bed...  Apparantly, someone lived here for a period
of time.  
 
This room appears to be a safe place to rest and heal.
You can go up to return to Candlekeep.

Day 1:
Bah, stupid mortals.  Keep summoning me to do their menial little
tasks, and never let me kill *anything*.  This is boring.  I'm 
supposed to find out about some "Veen" guy, or something. Whee.
Just what I'd like to do.
{x
Day 2:
This may not be such a bad job after all.  I found a few rooms with
plenty of corpses, and I had some fun with them for a while.  Still
no sign of that Venn person.
{x
Day 3:
I found him.  Daaamn.  THIS is the kinda guy I'd like to work for.
He's buff, he's witty, and he's got some really neat swords on his
back... a frost one, a fire one, lightning, and acid.  He also has
one made of pure magic, and one, my favorite, that sucks the life
out of mortals.  However, he does have a holy sword, so my opinion
of him isn't as good as it could be.  Eh, well... maybe I'll try
to hook up with him when Clarie is done with me.
{x
Day 4:
Ow.  One of Venn's buddies, a lesser doppleganger, got mad and 
sprayed something in his eyes, blinding him.  Venn got *pissed*,
and started tossing fireballs everywhere.  He blew the almighty 
(scratched out) out of the entire room... not to mention his 
follower.  I wouldn't want to be in his shoes, I'll tell you 
that... if there's anything left of 'em.
{x
Day 5:
I tried to sneak up to Venn to get a closer look, but some...
well, magical field of some sort made me go visible.  I have
the feeling he doesn't like invisible morties either, because
he launched off a meteor swarm at me... I wonder if I can ask
Clarieboy for some hazard pay, I deserve it.
{x
Day 6:
Both of Venn's shields appears to be enchanted to resist a
certain type of attack, but I don't know what yet.  I don't
plan on getting close enough to find out, either.  Still no
reply on the hazard pay, stingy (scratched out).
{x
Day 7:
Venn had some fun with a ghoul today.  He entangled it, cast
a curse spell on it, and then slowly cut it apart.  He was
enjoying it quite a bit... more reason for me to like him.
{x
Day 8:
Venn has a whole lot of potions.  I checked inside his pack
today, and he has enough to last a lifetime... they don't
look extremely powerful, but they are more than powerful
enough to slow down fighting him...
{x
Day 9:
One more day and I'm off this wretched job!  Something
I've noticed is that Venn's equipment seems partially
tied to his soul... as in, he dies, some of his stuff
will go with.  The link isn't strong enough to make it
so that all of it goes away, and it seems rather random
what will happen, but I can't be sure.  Venn seems to be
getting more cautious lately, and I can't understand
why...
{x
Day 10:
Venn is on the prowl, looking for something.  I don't
know where he is at the moment, and I'm just writing this
last entry so Clar doesn't whine.  I'm heading back right
after I finish thi
(At this point in the book, there is a splash of what looks
like black blood.)
{x
Epilogue:
I hate Venn.  He snuck up on me and whacked me a good one
with his holy sword, I just barely made it back to Clar's
place.  Clar doesn't seem like *such* a bad guy, he said
he was sorry and he healed me up, but he's still a mortal.
He also released me from his service, and I'm just writing
this out of gratitude, and to let anyone know these facts:
Venn *will* kill you.  Venn *is* more deadly than expected.
Venn *will* do things you don't expect, and when you least
expect him to.  And most importantly, Venn is *not* like
anything else in these realms.  Fighting him with the same
methods as used anywhere else will only get you killed.
Read this well, and waste the (scratched out) for me.

architect designed the catacombs with so many useless hallways.  Some
decoration might liven the hall up a bit...  Some curtains, a touch of
paint, a few flowers, for example.  Yet none of those are present
here, and thus, ultimately, the hall is boring.

{DPlain, boring, featureless hall.  The hall seems to be so
pointless, so empty of purpose, that a nearly tangible void of
creativity can be sensed.  Maybe, after years of utter lack of decor,
the hall shall become a dreaded Sphere Of Interesting Things
Destruction, seeking out and disintigrating all that has a meaning or
purpose.  Yet, that would give the Sphere itself a purpose, would it
not?  
 
Then, would not the sphere turn upon itself?  If so, that would cause
a paradox that very well might destroy all of reality...
 
Or maybe it would just disappear in a puff of logic and never be seen
again.  Who knows?

{DA psychologically profound hall~
~
{DThe featureless hall ends here, but along with the end comes a
revelation...  The blank and boring walls serve to enlighten the
traveller within them!  When faced with a lack of interesting things
to see or hear, the mind reacts by folding deep into itself, coming up
with thoughts not previously attainable.  The architect must be a
genius, for this may be one of the most profound statements on
psychology that has ever been seen!  
 
Or... maybe you're just reading into things a bit far.
 
No matter the deeper purpose of this hall, one thing that stands out as
obvious is the faint wheezing sound heard within.

The back half of this room is filled with staggering amounts of
treasure.  Silver, gold, and platinum from every mint in the realms. 
Also in the room are large amounts of obviously magical items,
glowing, flaming, and crackling with mystic energies.  However, a
large and seemingly impenetrable wall of force seperates you from the
treasure.  Standing before the mystical wall is a large, onyx statue
of Savras The All-Seeing, and before the statue is a wide, shallow
marble bowl that is set into the floor.

"For my magic be renewed once again"
"And have faith as I lie in waiting"
{x
And below these words are the familiar, ancient

"Give to me thy jewelry."
"I shall change it."
"I shall seal its story within me."
"And a blank slate shall be giv'n."{x

say Good, good, this is what I needed.
say ...however, I have grave news.
say In the realm of the Duergar Dwarves, some brave adventurers attacked the Tarrasque.
say They were victorious, but they did not wholly destroy the body.
say Part of what they left untouched regrew into the Tarrasque.
say The rest... grew into a second.  It is small yet, which is why it is imperative someone destroys it now!
say Go to the Duergar caves, brave one, and find the child's lair... then destroy it!
say I have faith in your skills... but I only pray they will be enough.
