Surprisingly young for a man so accomplished, Gildamesh
has used this fact to his advantage many a time.  A light
brown goatee is kept neatly trimmed on his face.  On his

With ever flowing brown locks and sharp looks,
Soumet is well known for her ability to ensnare
the hearts of men.  Her greatest of works however,
is said to be the fact that she was able to wed
her entire original adventuring company within the
span of under two years.  She still remains married
to the last of these men on a technicality, even as

before moving on.  Rumor tells that she is currently

offered within these lands, many have underestimated
the power wielded by these large snakes.  And in
due course, many have only too late, realized their
mistake in doing so.  Extremely useful while in
their element, many choose the constrictor due to
it's size and fierce appearance alone.

Shipped in from islands distant and tropical these
birds are often used for either messenger bird or
at times merely for amusement as they are one of
the few animals on the continent which can easily
be trained to speak in the tongues of creatures
of intelligence.  Furthermore they are often times
chosen by headhunters and assassins as they can in
fact be taught to be of use in battle.

Though regularly closed, these towering gates welcome any into

Reknown for being able to make the largest watercraft in all of

orders in the Marketplace, to the huge warehouse that stands here now.
Scaffolds fill this factory, allowing river boats of all sizes to be
built.  Fishing and trade being the livelyhood of Daggerdale, it is no
great wonder that this business has been quite successful by supplying
the demand of Daggerford's people.  A sign is placed on the wall here.

more battle hardened.  Newcomers often wonder why it is that this part
of the city usually is quiet and orderly, especially being so close to

The road has been built considerably wider at this point as if to
allow vast amounts of traffic to pass through.  Many consider this
street to be the industrial point of Daggerford, and as such it is
often treated as the business district of the city.  Formerly, the
sector which never slept, the recent move of the jail as well as the

tiered ceilings decorate the view above, while stone masonry has been
built over the straw walls that originally were built to house the
main hall.  It is rumored that magical protections have been placed
upon this room to prevent people from entering unwanted, or discern

the blinds are drawn or the sun outside has gone down.  The scene from
outside of the window is slightly less cozy as it shows little more

Within these walls, the hardest criminals of the region have been
housed...  Many of them released only by the sweet embrace of restful
death.  Almost fitting to this is the noose which hangs as an ill omen
from the stone ceiling within the room.  The cold stone floors are
covered with a slick slimelike substance, discouraging inmates from
trudging around barefoot.  To the north lies a small lighted
compartment, to the west, the room opens up considerably.  Eastward is
the huge metal door which offers no hope of escape, and a continual
reminder of the sentence at hand.

Well worn hardwood provides the flooring within this large

the city militia during the hours in which they are not either
training or roaming the country side on patrol.  The militia creed

Crowded and lively no matter what time of day or night, the Lady
Luck Tavern has always been revered as one of the cornerstones of
Daggerford.  Formerly a warehouse within the Rivermen's Quarter when
it extended this far into the city, it has been finely converted into
the bustling tavern which lies here today.  The inner walls have been
paneled with wood, even as high up as the second story level which can
be seen as it's center is open and looks down upon the main floor.  A
large {8black dragon wing{x is canopied over the bar effectively shading
those sitting at the bar from the lights of the tavern.  
 
A lone {8si{xlv{Wer{x goblet sits at the edge of the bar.

Though called the 'Market Square' this large patch of dirt is
nothing of the sort.  A long rounding circle covered with vendor
stands and stables makes up the hub of Daggerford's trading community.
Completely exposed to the elements as many cities, it is not all too
rare that a market day is called off on account of the weather.  Some
of the merchants who sell here frequent the city often, setting up
stands rather than moving in to avoid paying city taxes.  Others just
happen to be passing through, either headed to or from Waterdeep.

packed hard with dirt.  Upon this dirt, merchants tables and stands
are scattered about, save a small area in the center of the field. 
Though many shops are located within Daggerford, many of the locals
elect to shop here due to the low prices and greater variety which the
outside traders bring.

To both the west and eastern fronts great fields of grain rise to
great heights.  It is said that even in the winter, they grow tall as
ever due to the magic of Delfin 'Yellowknife'.  This marks the end of
the farmlands within the city walls.  Though many farms lie outside of
the city proper, most of their protection comes from the 3rd Company
of Waterdeep.  The city has made it clear that in the event of an
attack, farms outside of the will not be guaranteed protectection,

Across both sides of this narrow landing a stone railway keeps
wayward (or intoxicated) travelers from hurtling over the edge and
into the darkness of the massive crevice below.  Though not incredibly
deep, the crevice is not all that wide, and as such does not allow for
sunlight to filter down into it's depths.  This illusion has worked
wonders when repelling attacks from the Marsh.

To the west, a well worn city street passes north out of
Daggerford's great northern gate.  The same street continues south
into the very heart of the city.  The street which now runs west and

Perhaps the darkest monument of Daggerford, a huge ancient tower
has been built into the wall here, rising above the very city wall
itself.  Dubbed Delfin's Tower by the city after the mage moved in for
exchange of his magical services, it has slowly but surely been
rebuilt to allow for liveable conditions.  Rumor has it though, that
Delfin is still dealing with the undead which used to inhabit the old
guard tower.

The clinking of change and the rustle of paper currencies being
exchanged are the dominant sounds within this large hall.  Many
prospective casino workers and gamblers show up here each day in hopes
of being sent out into the realms to bring back the large haul.  It is
here that such hopefuls often times lend their services out to those
adventurers and business owners whom they deem a good investment.  But
as with everyhing else in the realms, such services come at a price.

In the far back corner of the hut, you find a few small cabinets
and a large, flat worktable.  The table is pitted with hammer
markings, probably made as shields were flattened.  Underneath this
table are a plethora of tools: large hammers, pliers and wrenches, and
many brads for fastening the lower quality shields together.  The
larger shields are solid, one piece.  From the complex engravings on
some of the larger shields, you can tell this Blacksmith has probably
received his training abroad, perhaps in Waterdeep.  Perhaps he will
teach you a thing or two if you make it worth his while.

This is the entrance room to the Stables.  Straw and hay cover the
floor, one or two inches deep.  It gives a little each time you take a
step.  Above you, the roof is in shambles, letting in light on the
surroundings.  The ventilation is not what it should be, but the holes
in the roof give way to a slightly better air circulation.  To the
North you see a series of stalls, each with a different animal in it. 
They are quite large and look sturdy enough to mount.  To the East you
see smaller animals.  They look into your eyes with longing.  A small
plaque is on the wall pointing to different types of animals.
