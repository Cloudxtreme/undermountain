You are now on a huge cross that is almost the size of a person.  You can
climb up and sit on it and overlook the whole city of ZoZo.  You see all
around you the city and its alley system that seems to go to nowhere.  You
see bums collecting food for themselves and other people.  You see the life
of a city...

On The Roof Of The Church~
~
On top of the church on its holy roof.  The roof has not been blessed but
it is full of holes that let the water fall into and make the church rot
even faster.  The roof makes a small noise right before a piece falls in.

City Hall Of Zozo~
~
You are at the entrance of the City Hall Of Zozo.  Before you
stands the city hall that runs Zozo.  The hall is pretty much empty, a
few desks are scattered all around.  Papers seem to blow by you in the
wind...  The walls are made out of black marble, and the room have
only very little light in it.  There are exits to all sides of you.

The Roads Department~
~
You stand at the Roads Department of Zozo.  A large desk stands in
the corner, in the corner so a person could sit at it and look out
both windows..  The papers on the desk seem to be piling up, and no
one is around to tend to them.  A large map hangs on the wall, torn
down the middle.  From what you can see it is a map of Zozo.

with a stack of papers piling up on it.  You see the last newspaper
hanging on the wall, the date reads 1247...  The window to the south
overlooks Beggars Row, and the southern streets of Zozo.  The black
buildings and gangs move around the city.

Chairs are lined up around the table...

Danger. The Train is very dangerous, the exits behind you will dissappear and
you will be trapped with the ghosts. Only the brave enter. The whole train is
a death trap with no way out and no recalling. The only way out besides
immortal help is to kill the train and exit.
