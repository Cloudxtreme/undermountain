hartham odunne dwarf man male~
{WH{war{8tham O'Dunne - {wWe{8apons Guru{x~
A short dwarven man sits at a stool behind the counter, sharpening an axe.
~
{8Hartham is something of an enigma.  He has never yet told
of his birthplace, nor of his parents, and doesn't seem
given over to start any time soon.  He is obviously of
dwarven parentage and has a long black braided beard that
hangs from his chin.  He wears simple leathers, though on
his head he wears a horned helm.  His green eyes watch over
the shop with a keen gaze and he makes deals with practiced
ease.{x

A halfling man stands on a ladder, polishing a dragon's scales.

{8As happy as a songbird in the sun, Niliwine seems to
{8take great joy in his job as clan dragon keeper.  The
dragons, too, seem to enjoy his pleasant demeanor and
considerate attention.  He stands no more than three
feet tall with a black mop of hair, tangled as his 
entire attention is on the dragons.  Brown eyes are
careful to never miss an itch or spot on the glowing
green scales of his charges.{x

A beautiful woman with silver skin sits on the couch, chatting.

{8Merrideth is obviously not of this world.  She is one of
the Argenachs, a Rilmani devoted to keeping balance in the
world.  Her skin is light silver, and her matching hair is
pulled back into a ponytail.  Her light silver eyes are
friendly and extremely knowledgeable.  She seems very eager
to have her people assist members of the Keepers in main-
taining balance.{x

stands out from his head in a shock, and his brown eyes
have long been covered by a pair of thick glasses.  He
works with practiced dexterity, and more than a few burns

{8Darmath Tallwillow is the son of one of the greatest potions
masters ever... but today isn't his day.  It never honestly 
seems to be his day.  He consistently sits on his stool, his
gray eyes squinted to read recipes written in the tiny scrawl
of his father's hand, black hair falling into his face.  Every
now and again he lets out a puff to clear the hair away, and
carefully adds another component to his potion batch...{x

{8It is odd, to say the least, that a satyr would wish to
serve food, much less cook - but Mortimar is the exception
to the rule.  He wears a tuxedo suit coat, his goat-like
legs bare and covered in long, black hair (well groomed,
mind you).  His horns are polished and hair combed.  With
a superior air, he offers up the feasts he has prepared.{x

attack is anyone's guess... just be happy it doesn't.{x

{gJust add hot water, right?  Oh so wrong!  The beauty of tea
{gis that it, just like people, have the right temperatures as
{gwell as the right times that they enjoy.  While there is 
{galways room to adjust a cup of tea to your own tastes - making
{gthem stronger or weaker - it is good form to know the true
{gnature of your tea and what it likes most.
{x
{gOf note:  One should NEVER pour boiling water on their tea!
{gAlways remove your water from the heat source BEFORE using it,
{gallowing the water to be at the appropriate temperature while
{gstill.  Boiling water leads to rapid leeching and a rather
{gtart taste to your teas as it pulls the tannins directly out.
{x
{gSecondly:  To lower the caffeine content of any tea, pour hot
{gwater onto your tea and allow it 30 seconds to steep.  Pour off
{gthat water and add water again for a second steeping - timing
{gthis one appropriately.  Caffeine leeches out within the first
{gthirty seconds of steeping and gathers in the water - remember
{gthis for night time pots of bliss.
{x
{gHere are the general rules of thumb:
{x
{8Black tea:  {g210F/95-100C for 2-3 minutes.
{yOolong tea: {g180F/80-85C  for 2-3 minutes.
{gGreen tea:  {g170F/75-80C  for 1-2 minutes.
{wWhite tea:  {g150F/65-70C  for 1-2 minutes.
{mHerbal:     {g210F         up to 6 minutes depending on whether

{x
{gWhile you may decide to use magic to continually keep your tea
{gfresh, followers of unadulterated methods will find that tea

{gstay freshest the longest in the dark and in an air-tight

{gless.  Herbals should be used within a year for maximum

{gMany are confused by the differences in tea and are, in fact,

{g
{gTea comes from the plant, camellia sinensis, and is found in
{gvery few places within the realms.  True tea comes from this
{gplant only, and ALL tea comes from this plant.
{g
{gWhite tea is the very tops of the plant, the young leaves, and
{ghas the lowest caffeine content.  Green tea comes from the 
{gmiddle to lower section of the plant, the mature leaves, and
{ghas a middling caffeine content.  Black tea comes from the
{goldest leaves and is often aged just a bit before it is brewed.
{gBlack tea has the most caffeine content of all teas.
{g
{gOther types of teas are Oolong - a tea sun oxidized and 
{glightly fermented before being brewed.  Oolong as a wonderful 
{groasted and rich, "chewy" flavor.  Pu-erh Tea is tea that is
{gtruly fermented and aged before being brewed.  Contrary to what
{gis out there, true Pu-erh is some of THE most expensive tea in
{gthe world and can be aged up to thirty years for a deeply 
{gcomplex flavor.
{g
{gAll others made from herbs, while colloquially considered "tea"
{gare actually herbal infusions.  Don't let this stop you from
{gconsidering your herbs teas - for they have the power to heal,
{gcalm, soothe, and invigorate.{x

{g     {gI{Gn{yt{groduction:
{x
{g           Welcome to the wisdom of the wood!  I am Sanria, a
{g      long time sage  of the realms, and I am here to lend to
{g      you my knowledge and  understanding of  trees, how they 
{g      can  be helpful to your  studies, and how they may lend
{g      aid to those in trouble.
{x
{g           It is useful to note  that those without sage-like 
{g      abilities may  find that this book  is not very useful.
{g      While  it will give  you deeper understanding  into the
{g      world of  the sage, you  may need  to ask a sage if you 
{g      are interested in speaking to the trees yourself.
{x
{g           First, and most importantly, trees are individuals,
{g      but work  as a collective.  That  means that  there are 
{g      times you may request help from the trees and their vast
{g      networks covering the globe will be able to triangulate
{g      a  location  for a given  person.  Of course, this will 
{g      only happen provided the person is in an area with trees.  
{g      Some will be happy to help, others will not.
{x
{g           "Sage" wisdom  will be found within  the leaves of 
{g      not only this book, but the trees themselves.

{g     T{Gy{yp{ges of Forests:
{x
{g         Boreal forests are filled with trees that are much 
{g     less  likely to  help.  These  trees, crusted with the 
{g     chill of the north, primarily keep  to themselves.  It 
{g     is best, when  working exclusively with  them, to keep
{g     your  questions short and  to the point, but still re-
{g     spectful.  
{x
{g          Temperate forests yeild the most varied attitudes, 
{g     and it all depends on where in the realms you are. Some 
{g     of the  trees in  this forest you will find are very o-
{g     pen, with  personalities  that bubble  forth, some are 
{g     filled with stiff wisdom, some are cynical, while oth-
{g     ers shed jokes as frequently as their leaves in the fall.
{g
{g          Tropical and  subtropical forests  are quite laid 
{g     back and very unrushed.  Their unhurried attitudes re-
{g     quire you to be prepared to stay a while when speaking 
{g     with them and in some cases, bring offerings of herbs 
{g     and earth from other places in the realms.

{G          Oak

{g          A tree venerable and wise, they tend to speak in
{g          parables, or in  long vernacular with a penchant 
{g          for minor condescention.  It is best to approach 
{g          an oak with humble patience.
{x
 
{G          Birch
{g
{g          Grumpy and cynical, a birch will not speak to 
{g          you  if it feels  you are beneath its notice.  
{g          They tend to enjoy jokes at the expense of o-
{g          thers, pointing  out the  obvious, and making 
{g          things difficult.
{x
{x
{G          Maples
{g
{g          All very good natured and humble, these trees
{g          tend to have a simple attitude toward life and 
{g          do not seem  to delve deeply into lifes' mys-
{g          teries - preferring to take each day as a span 
{g          of moment in which they dwell.
{x
{x
{G          Magnolias
{g
{g          Rather  selfish, these  trees prefer to spend
{g          their time  doting  on their  own  concerns - 
{g          squirrels in the branches, deer eating bark - 
{g          than yours. They are difficult to communicate 
{g          with, and often will send you on your way be-
{g          fore sharing any information.
{x
{x
{G          Elm
{x
{g          A seeming cross between the oak and the maple, 
{g          these trees feel  almost like a  young oak but 
{g          with a much greater appreciation for humor and 
{g          good spirits.{x

{G          Pine
{x
{g          A name encompassing a myriad of types, pines in 
{g          general have a  wary disposition, preferring to 
{g          keep to themselves and speak in riddles when in-
{g          teracting with any not of their species.

{G          Cedar
{x
{g          One of the most  irascible  trees I've  ever en-
{g          countered, a cedar is just as likely to tell you 
{g          the truth as it is to tell a falsehood. They are 
{g          very condescending, and tend to believe that any 
{g          tree that isn't a cedar isn't worth its roots.
{x
{x
{G          Fir
{x
{g          Quirky and curious, a fir is a relatively friend-
{g          ly tree, and will help in many instances provided 
{g          you return the favor with information and sate its 
{g          curious demeanor.

{x
{G          Redwood
{x
{g          Very noble and knightly, these trees will always
{g          give advice along a virtuous path. Ever ready to 
{g          help, they will always side  with those  of good 
{g          intentions.
{x
{x
{G          Juniper
{x
{g          A  thoughtful type  of tree, a  Juniper tends  to 
{g          take a lot of time mulling over facts before giv-
{g          ing a reply.  Be ready to spend hours on a single 
{g          question, for a Juniper does take pride in relat-
{g          ing how  facts  relate to every  single aspect of 
{g          life.  They are philosophers on a millenious time 
{g          scale.

{g     S{Gp{ye{gaking Tree
{g
{g          Speaking to a tree is an exercise in superior 
{g     listening.  Their speech is not like ours, audible 
{g     and  created by  a voice box, but  deep within the 
{g     wood of  the tree - a  vibration in  the ether  of 
{g     magic itself.  Time and training will teach you to 
{g     tune  in  to  the various  vibrations, and  slowly 
{g     learn what each vibration means.  
{g
{g          In time, you  will learn  how to return those 
{g     vibrations into the wood of the tree, "speaking" to 
{g     the tree and allowing it to learn from you as well.  
{g
{g          Again, not  every magic  user has this  skill 
{g     set,  and, indeed, it seems the skill is very par-
{g     ticular to the druid and sage sect. Never be afraid 
{g     to seek out a sage when you are in need of help in 
{g     speaking to trees.

{g          If you would like to learn more, you may direct a

{g     Take heart  in knowing that  all around you, the forest 
{g     is alive and is taking in everything that goes on. Rumor 
{g     abounds  that some sages, elders  and wise, have  found 
{g     ways to even coax memories of trees from the very pages 
{g     of books.  I've found none that can do this, but it has 
{g     not stopped me from trying.

{g          Enjoy your  walks, breathe  deep, and don't forget 
{g     to not only stop to smell the roses, but ask a tree how 
{g     it's doing!

{g     T{Gy{yp{ges of Trees:
{x
{g          In  general, coniferous trees  are much more con-
{g     servative than deciduous trees.  Broad leaves are more 
{g     wise than those with narrow leaves, and as always, the 
{g     older the tree, the more wise it will be.  This is not 
{g     always the  case - as  sometimes you  will find a tree 
{g     that is a child at heart!
{x
{g          Here is a list of some of the more populous trees 
{g     and their general attitudes.  Remember, that these are 
{g     loose guidelines, as you may find a redwood embittered 
{g     by a lightning strike, an oak irritated by bark beetles, 
{g     and even a pine that thinks riddles are foolish.  
{x
{g          No matter what, always approach the trees with no-
{g     thing less than respect.

{r     Name's Skive and I'm a gnome  but I'm also a pilot. How?  You

{r     It's possible for you, too, to be just as big as the skyheads 
{r     if you  know what you're  doing and do it better than  anyone 
{r     else.
{x
{r     I'm a  no-nonsense pilot and  I'm going to teach you not only 
{r     how to handle your self, but your captain, too.  Yes, they're 
{r     your responsibility as well.  Get used to it.
{x

{R     Piloting:
{r
{r     Piloting's no job for someone who likes to do it halfassed, so
{r     don't think you can just grab a little flight time and make it
{r     onto a ship.  If  you're small in stature, you have to make up
{r     for it in even bigger ways, and that means being the best. You
{r     need to learn from the best.
{r     
{r     First, you  have to  decide what type of ship you want to fly. 
{r     Me?  My favorite ship is the  Highwind.  It's nimble enough to 
{r     zip through  the skies (provided your employer paid for decent 
{r     engines), and big enough to feel like a real machine. With the 
{r     right crew  under your  wings, the thing purrs  like a newborn 
{r     displacer beast.
{x
{r     Before you  ever step  into an  job office, you'd  better know 
{r     everything there is know about your ship. Specs, engines, rooms, 
{r     navigating  capacities, pressure  capacity, everything down to 
{r     the colors you can pick for the captain's  chair.  Our reputa-
{r     tion is riding on YOU.
{r     
{r     Second, you have to know how to fly the damned thing. It's hard
{r     enough knowing how  to handle yourself when a leggy skyhead is
{r     teaching  you.  They conveniently forget  that you can't reach 
{r     the  overhead  lighting  system, or the peddals  to adjust for 
{r     rudder pitch and yaw.  Best  to find a pilot like yourself who 
{r     knows their stuff and knows it with their eyes closed.
{r
{r     Third, you have to know your captain. Mine happens to be a lady,
{r     which brings a whole suit of problems.  She tends to go off on 
{r     adventures  half ready all  the time, her head lost in whoever 
{r     she happens to be layin' chase to.  I am always ready at a mo-
{r     ment's notice to go to the ship, and always have a supply pack 
{r     ready knowing she's probably forgotten her coat when she takes 
{r     off up north.
{r     
{r     Last, you have to have a kick ass crew to back you up.  That's
{r     right - a pilot  is only a glorified knob turner if he doesn't
{r     have engineers and crew  to back him up.  Engineers are sorely
{r     lacking  on a lot of ships, which is  easily fixed if you're a 
{r     gnome.  If not, make  some friends and  find out what needs to 
{r     happen to get  them on your ship.  It's a guarantee  that just
{r     about any issue that crops up will be fixed in a snap. If your
{r     captain doesn't want to pay the extra, find a new captain!

{R     Learning to Fly:
{x
{r     Like I said, learning to fly a ship first  starts with finding
{r     a ship to love.  Yeah, I said it.  You have to love your ship.
{r     If you don't, you might as well give up now.  People the size
{r     of human children who can't prove they are zealous and passion
{r     ate got no  business in the  world of the skyheads.  It's hard
{r     enough without you making it harder on those of us who want to
{r     do this with a burning fever.
{x
{r     Once you find a ship that calls your name like a beckoning lover,
{r     you gotta learn all you can about her. If you can find someone
{r     who  will let you  climb on board, get in  there and touch the 
{r     controls.  Sit in the  seat, imagine yourself there and if you
{r     can see it - then you need to start seeking out a teacher.
{r     
{r     Best way to find  someone of  your own size that can teach you 
{r     is to  get word out in your home town.  I'm partial to seeking
{r     out gnomes, but you might find as a dwarf or halfling that you
{r     have your own  needs.  If you can't find one in your hometown,
{r     go to Port Torregiano and put up a notice.  
{x
{r     You can  always learn from  a skyhead, but just  remember that 
{r     they don't always have your best interests at heart. They don't 
{r     care if you fail, they expect you to, as they get their money.
{r     Save yourself the trouble and go small to be big.

{R     Know your Captain:
{r
{r     For all the  insane craziness my captain  puts me through, she
{r     pays  well and lets me run much of the ship without her input.
{r     That kind of trust can't be bought, and you'll find that there
{r     are  some captains  who rule with an iron  fist like  you're a
{r     slave instead of a paid crew member.  You can always walk away
{r     before  you sign a contract, so think long and hard before you
{r     jot down your name to pilot.
{r
{r     A good  way is to ask  around - what have  other pilots  heard
{r     about your  captain?  If they have a reputation of blowing th-
{r     rough pilots like used potion  vials, it's time  to look else-
{r     where  for a job.  If no  one has anything bad to say, but no-
{r     thing good - it's time to do a little work.
{r     
{r     Invite your prospective captain out for a bite to eat.  No, it 
{r     isn't a date, you aren't as fool as to do something like that- 
{r     even if you do want to.  Ask your prospective captain questions.  
{r     Find out  how much you'd be  paid, where  you'd be expected to 
{r     fly and under what conditions, and if you have a place to stay 
{r     on the ship when docked  or if you'll be  provided an inn room 
{r     where you go.  Ask now so you're not sorry later.

{R     Finding a Crew:
{x
{r     My crew is entirely gnome, and that was granted by my captain.
{r     I had no troubles getting her to see my point of view when she
{r     hired me on - I  needed a group I trusted all the way, and she
{r     gave me absolute freedom in hiring who I wanted.  If you don't
{r     have the  same freedom from your captain, you better well make
{r     sure you can have  a say in some way  or another  or you might 
{r     end up  with a shipswain that you can't stand and would rather
{r     push out the porthole than work beside.
{r     
{r     Torregiano is a fine place to advertise for crew.  Port Torre-
{r     giano has  plenty of places  to put up a slip of paper letting
{r     people  know there  are openings.  Just  be wary of  who comes
{r     along - sky  pirates aren't just some kids' tale.  If  you get
{r     one on your ship, woe be to you and your captain, too.

{8Welcome to the {bS{Bph{Ge{gre {bo{Bf {GM{gi{yn{gd{8, a subsect of the {bKe{Bep{Ger{gs of B{Gal{Ban{bce{8.
{x
{8This tome will not be long in explaining the functions of the Sphere,
and our goals within the ideology of the Keepers of Balance.  The hope,
however, is that you, dear follower, will not be brief in your studies.
{x
{8The {bS{Bph{Ge{gre {bo{Bf {GM{gi{yn{gd {8is a group within the keepers devoted to the persuit
of knowledge as it pertains to books, tomes, and scrolls.  We seek to
gain knowledge in the hopes that through learning all that we can, we
guard against repeating mistakes of the past, and guard against losing
{8knowledge that has long passed.
{x
{8If you find you have a love of books and a thirst for knowledge, then
the {bS{Bph{Ge{gre {bo{Bf {GM{gi{yn{gd {8is the perfect place for you to call home.  Our
group is always willing to teach and share knowledge with others in
return for discovering knowledge in all its forms.
{x
{8We do not seek to abuse the knowledge we gain from the realms and 
{8beyond, but we seek to steward and safeguard it for generations to
come.  Through deep study we apply the tenants of the Keepers of 
Balance, ever mindful that the knowledge we gain is not complete with-
out sharing it.  Through this sharing we achieve balance, and through
balance, wisdom.

{8The {bS{Bph{Ge{gre {bo{Bf {GM{gi{yn{gd {8has but a few codes that one must live and abide
{8by to remain a member.  Below you shall find them.  Take them to 
heart and keep them sacred to your core.
{x
{W***
{8The ultimate goal in the persuit of knowledge is to become a keeper
{8of knowledge and a repository of wisdom for all.
{x
{W***
{8We do not seek to gain power through study and learning, as to do so
{8would create an imbalance, and would go against the teachings of the
{8Rilmani and the Keepers of Balance.
{x
{W***
{8We should never lose ourselves so completely in study that we neglect
{8to carry out the ideals of the Keepers of Balance, and the {bS{Bph{Ge{gre {bo{Bf
{GM{gi{yn{gd{8.  Without sharing our understandings, we risk personal imbalances
as well as letting down our fellow clan members.
{x
{W***
{8Finally, we must constantly remember to respect our fellow members no
matter what their level of study or knowledge.  Our greatest gift should
be in not only learning, but sharing, teaching, and growing.

Magic is, paradoxically, both simple and complex.  The complexity lies in the
difficult mental disciplines that must be mastered, and the lifetime study to
find "true," usable, knowledge.  The actual use of magic is easy, once one has
learned how.  To utilize magic, the adept must learn mental disciplines and be
able to rid oneself of distracting thoughts and emotions, to concentrate upon
one thought, one sharp focus, in order to direct the Weave.  To be effective,
an adept must be able to take this art of concentration one step further and
be able to relax, clear his mind, and focus under the most distracting of
conditions.  It is a meditative art that must be learned to perfection before
an approach to the magical processes can be attempted.

Makou energy can be harnessed with the use of magical rods.  These
rods, enchanted with varies spells, will attract mako energy.  These
rods are placed in the reactor core of a Class A Makou Reactor.  The
rods attract the energy, gather it and sends it to the compression
chamber, through iron rods, wrapped into each other.  Steam from the
steam engines in the reactor compress the energy in the chamber which
is thrown between two iron rods, will cause a chemical reaction and
creature diffrent forms of mako.  Diffrent pressures will give
diffrent results, but depends on the reactor type.  Class A reactors
produce Makou Gas, which after compressed in the chambers, is pumped
out to storage tanks, and into your homes.  Most reactors are started
by coal for the steam engine, but after makou gas is produced, it
creates the fire for the steam engine.

Do you know what the sound of a thousand year old booby trap being
sprung sounds like?
{c
I do, though I wouldn't know where to begin as far as explaining it.
Mix a night of heavy drinking in Torregiano with an hour inside Curtis'
Shack, and then throw yourself off the top floor of Fanatics. Maybe 
you'd get an idea how I feel right now.
{c
No?

Perhaps if I start from the beginning, I could win your empathy.

{c
Let me see, I suppose I should start with three days ago, since my
story began then.  Well it actually began about 170 years ago, but
never mind the details...
{w
I remember the colors drifting in and out of my field of view.  The
loud rush of silence rang in my ears. Patterns of darkness swirled
and gathered into focus. My head swam with confusion.  It was the
ceiling of my bedchambers, set in what would one day become my grand
archive. {c(For those who don't know, I sleep there also).
{M
"How, where?" {wI whispered, startled by the strangeness of my own
voice.{M "It is real?!"
{w
But I cannot deny my own senses. It was if I had awakened, or been
pulled, from some other reality into a world that remained until this
day an afterthought. My mind grasped for the retreating fibers of a
dream set in the depths of reality, but came up empty handed.
{w
I rose to my feet as beads of chilling sweat ran down my face. A pile
of ashes lay scattered across my bed. They disintegrated to the touch.
I looked over to the perpetus counter on the bed stand.  It had
stopped quarter phase mid-month. My muscles ached immensely, almost to
the point of atrophy.  As I started to move, I became aware that my
equipment had become tangled in the bed sheets.  Why I chose to sleep
fully geared was beyond me.  I reasoned it as yet another mystery to
solve.
{w
I stumbled over to the chest of drawers, the hardware black with
tarnish, and leaned upon the timber for support. Looking into the
mirror, which hung nearby, a faint image of myself came into view
amidst the scattered moonbeams.  It was an apparition that I met eye-
to-eye--long beard, bony face, and wrinkled complexion.  Apparently, I
had overextended the benefits of beauty sleep.
{w
I rubbed the shaggy beard and backed away from the image.  Some things
were familiar, like my clothes and the furniture, but others were not, 
ike who the hell I was.
{w
I walked through the hallway, passing piles of masonry and unmixed
mortar to the foyer.  Directly ahead was the library, the door still
slightly ajar, and to the right was the doorway outside, which I
approached.  The deadbolt would not budge, and so, unsheathing my
sword, I proceeded to beat it into submission with the hilt.  It
finally gave, and the door opened with a loud creak. I stepped outside
into the foreboding depths of Drannor Forest, but don't ask me where I
thought I was going.

{W
"Clank" {wcame the sound of the door behind me. Out of reflex, I raised
my hands with some jarbled jargon at the tip of my tongue. Though I
felt foolish when I realized my haste, my actions sparked one of those
rare moments of serendipity.  I was, of course, a wizard, who found
little more use out of his sword than the Dragon Queen would find out
of a wedding dress.
{w
I commanded a vocabulary of arcane knowledge, and to this point had
been very modest in employing it.
{w
First off was this little business about starving to death. I called
upon some food, and to my dismay, a colorful fungus sprung up at my
feet. It looked more like a drug-induced piece of artwork than edible,
nothing like the rations I used to know.  I kicked it slightly with my
boot and it went flying off into the darkness, undoubtedly safe from
anyone else who might stumble upon it.  
{M
"This will not do," {wI thought.  Something began to well up inside me.
Perhaps it was a powerful spell that would bring an end to space and
time.   Nope, it was my damned stomach, who would have been very
happy eating things that appear at one's feet, but I was more of the
finicky kind. My mind mulled over the notion of hungry and out came
a name.  I found the right words and hand gestures, and in an instant,
I was there.  I could get used to this...
{M
"Westbridge" {wI said to myself.  Now this was a familiar memory. 
{c
I always thought the name was deceiving for new adventurers, for when
they set out on a quest, they always headed east, since Westbridge was,
of course, west. If you really want to pull a sneaky on them, say that
you'll meet them in Thalos.
{w
I made my way from Temple Square to Market Square, then Festival
Square, which seemed to have been claimed by the mafia in a recent
event.  I must have slept through that one. I passed a pub on the way,
and found my way back to it. I ordered a bottle of 'local specialty'
but let's just say specialty is an over fancied word for piss. Across
the way was a cafe that looked inviting, but that was neither here nor
elsewhere in my desires.
{w
Making my way back toward the fountain, I veered left into a rundown
pit of a joint, better known to most as Tom's Bakery. There, I
purchased two massive pot pies and found my favorite table at the far
corner. It was marred with the carving of people's names I did not
recognize. Only faintly did I see my own, and that of a friend, which
remained freshly cut into the soft oak.  Tacked along the walls were
flyers advertising the arena, as well as several obscene comments hand
written below the contestants names.   A few made me laugh.
{w
And so I sat and ate my pies and nursed my ale and pondered things.
Memories trickled in like late runners in a marathon. Some were good,
many were bad, a few were just plain strange. I dwelled on each memory
just as I savored each bite of my breakfast. Of the last recollection
to jog in was my name...

{c
I was Clausius Sagacus, son of Valine, born in the Valley of Titans,
raised by elves, and admitted into the guild of sorcery the 17th year
of my worldfall. This resulted in the solitary life that I knew well,
and ultimately to my odd infatuation with the past. 
{c
Yes, yes, facts about myself, but I wouldn't be throwing them out
there if they did not bear some relevance to my tale.  My father
actually had a different name in mind for me, but my mother wouldn't
have it.  As if I actually knew either of them very well.  A story
for another time...
{c
Anyway, where was I?  Oh yes, sitting in the bakery drinking my
pisswater. I had to order a third pot pie to soak it up.  {wAs I
choked down the brew, I dove into the black soup that is my mind
for some more answers. There was a faint presence, almost alien,
in there. {m"Hello, there intruder. What are you doing inside there?"
{wNo answer.  I could hear it vaguely, laughing. It was gone again.
I sought it for answers, but nothing.  
{w
Then came a sound I could not mistake for my life...
{w
I was across the table in the time it took for the blade to be drawn.
It was Sunderfury.  Looking behind me, I soon saw the familiar face
of Gaolong laughing at me as he pointed his sword toward my food.
Before I could blink, he lifted it up in the air and caught it as it
slid down the length of his blade.  Gaolongs infernal laughing
drowned out the delicate ring of the blade.
{M
"You bastard" {wI protested, but I could not expect anything less from
him.  If ever you have a chance to meet him, you will find him to be
a rather showy character.  Just watch your dinner.
{G
Where you been?" {wGao asked between bites, {G"We thought you were dead.
{M
"I was a bit detained in my dreams," {wI said, not knowing what else to
say. {M"I just woke up from one hell of a sleep and found my way here.
What day is it anyway?"
{w
Gaolong thought a moment, tapping his sword against the ground as he
sat.  {G"13th of Uktar, if Im not mistaken.  Yah, thats the day!  I
got my match coming up."  {wHe pointed to the flyer with the words {W"Gao
Schlong" {wwritten beneath his name. A once crude depiction of him was
now adorned with a moustache and a pair of rose-tinted shades.  I
cracked an uncontrollable smile.
{w
Uktar...Crunching the numbers in my head, I came up with approximately
9 months of slumber, and only if it was still the same year.  It was
a miracle that I was still alive, but the whole situation had the
hints of powerful magics at play.  Though I was curious about how
long it really had been, I decided it was best that I didnt know
just yet.  When you get my age, a couple of years of sleep could do
you good. Hell, waking up every morning is a blessing, so why push it.
{w
I looked over Gaolong with admiration.  He had acquired a few more
interesting pieces of equipment that glimmered with his own personal
touches.  Most were mangled so badly with his own personal touches,
that no one else would want to touch it.  A few more scars, but other
than that, he hadnt changed a bit.  I forwarded the question {M"So
whats new in the realms?" {wto which I received a long reply...

{w
So for perhaps the next three hours we caught up on things. As you
could imagine, the conversation was a bit one-sided. A few highlights
involved people that I never was fond of leaving the world, presumed
dead, and there were some newcomers who had been coming around that
from the sound of it weren't half bad. The sight of airships was
apparently no big thing now, and it seemed that everyone who's anyone
carried with them relics that had appeared out of the west. When Gao
told this part, he stressed the details, not doubt appealing to my
blatant curiosity. {M"I should have to build a new wing in my archives
for these things" {wI said to him.  Of course he countered with a snide
remark that I have censored here, mainly because I can.
{w
But of all the new things he filled me in on, perhaps the most
intriguing was this business of a new order of government. I vaguely
remember the declaration some time before my unfortunate accident.
Speculations made rounds that internal corruption had weakened the
Tripower Empire, and that factions were a last ditch effort to keep
order.  Another popular one was that these so called 'factions' were
only puppets to a dictator who would take the stage in the next scene.
I had to discount the latter, for reasons that will become evident
shortly.  As long as there will be glory hounds, there will be
speculation.
{w
We wound up our conversation with a few lighthearted remarks and the
Gao stood up and said {G"I have a match to prepare for, so I must get
going.  I am going to try out some new equipment, so wish me luck!"
{wAs he walked out the door, he stabbed a piece of paper with his sword
and lifted it towards me.  {G"Page 3 has something interesting that I
didnt get around to mentioning.  Have a look!"
{w
Pulling the page from his sword, he bid me good day and I resumed my
seat in the corner.  The front page was plastered with the following
headline: {W"The People Have Spoken:  Pax Faerunis to Rule Westbridge
Territory." {wFrom there was dwarfed the actual article which read from
an account of the polls.  There was a boxed list of members to the
left, and I could recall many of the names, despite my disjointed
memory.  They were a nice bunch really, and I would have time later
on to congratulate them once this business of getting settled back
into my life was over.  On the next page was a smaller heading that
read, {W"Other Factions To Rule Various Parts of the Realms" {wand second
from the top of a short list was a name which struck me like a brick:
{w
The Keepers of Antiquity...
{w

{M
"Why that rat bastard did it!" {wI muttered to myself as glared at the
paper.  
{c
Here is a good time to explain that the Keepers of Antiquity was an
idea never realized in my prior state. It was an idea I held onto for
perhaps most of my life, with two attempts made at building a great
archive set to preserve the legacy of our world. Both of those attempts,
I would say, have failed, but the latter made for one hell of a
summer home.  
{c
The premise behind the Keepers was a group of good-natured individuals,
who would take up the ambiguous task of cataloging and preserving the
world as we know it and once knew it. The need for preservation came to
me when I was very young, after my exile from the Valley of Titans
while in the company of elves (I shall save this story for later, if
time and the audience permits). It was the stories of the loss of one
of their greatest cities that drew me into my current occupation. It
was much later on that the Ruined City was found, and treasures poured
from its shattered gates into art galleries and private collections
across the realms, with little or no regard for what it once
represented.  It was a place shrouded in intrigue, and the shattered
remains of that great city are forever haunted by the demons who will
not let her spirit rest.  It was a place dear to my heart, which echoed
of the races who lived in harmony within.  It was my obsession.
{w
This takes my story up to that afternoon.  After a few strolls around
the city, I made my way back to the bakery for an early dinner. This
time I opted for the local ale, which was a little better. {cFor really
good ale, I suggest Jack's Bar in Torregiano. Damn good stuff, and you
meet interesting people there, too, which Ill get to in a moment. For
now, the interesting person of the day walked into the bakery at about
the time I sat down with my food.
{w
Barely making eye contact, he approached my table, boosted himself up
onto the chair, and smiled, his beard curling up on the marred tabletop
like a coiled snake.  With a rather raspy voice, he said, {C"Didn't take
long for you to crack it.  I knew if anyone could, it would have been
you."
{W

"Well Bosch, you are apparently the dwarf of the hour, so you tell me
what the hell is going on."  {wI replied, as I tossed the front page in
front of him.  {C"The scroll, you used it I assume," {whe said.  {C"I knew
you couldn't resist forever!" 
{w
Silence. Lots of sparks but no light bulb.
{w
I shook my head.  He laughed.  {C"Ok, ok, I understand you are confused.
Let me explain over dinner.  I am craving some fried chicken if you
will do the honors.  Oh right, another thing to cover..."
{w
And so he filled me in on everything leading up to my sleep. It all
came back to me at once, though I allowed him the pleasure of seeing
the story to its end.  In the interest of time, let me paraphrase his
tale:
{g
Our meeting was through the wizard's guild.  He was a new student
of the arts, with a lore for relics, both past and present.  His
knowledge of ancient facts was only paralleled by his ability to learn
new ones, and so I took him in as a student and gave him access to my
library and archives. It was also then that I told him of my plans to
construct a great archive, a place where all could come to find
information. He was immediately sold on the notion, and the Keepers of
Antiquity was mainly his brainchild. I should clarify and give credit
where it's due, for without Bosch, my idea remained only a scribble on
parchment.  
{g
He learned quickly and efficiently, though he was impulsive and
sometimes impatient.  Within half a year, he had exhausted all of the
resources from my archives and private library, and so it was decided
that an expedition into the Ruined City was in order. Under the veil
of invisibility, we slipped by the demons within and found our way
into an old shop; the original intent seemed to be a shop of magic,
judging from the arcane symbols which adorned the walls.  While
picking fragments of paper from the cracks of the stone floor, Bosch
stumbled upon a loose one, and beneath it was a crumpled scroll, tied
together with strands of leather.  
{g
We took it back with us, along with a few small items, and opened it
up.  Across the top, it bared the name: {8"Scroll of the Waking Mind"{g,
and the rest were bits of sentences and nonsensical phrases, most of
which were really funny when said aloud. In the interest of our
safety and well-being, I will not. 
{g
For weeks it sat upon my mantle, and in that time we probed it for
all of the secrets it contained.  Through stacks and stacks of books
we searched for a translation.  Nothing came from our efforts. 
{C
"And that is where I last left you.  We came looking for weeks
afterwards, but there must have been a spell ward active on you,
for all our efforts at contact failed"{w, Bosch concluded with a
sigh.  {C"We were thinking perhaps you grew tired of us and left for
your old solitude."
{w
That last statement actually sounded appealing to me, though I
refrained from mentioning it.  I continued the story where he
left off.  {M"It stayed with me for quite a long time afterwards,
going where I did in hopes I would find the right person to help me
decipher it." {wI continued.  {M"The right person can come at the
strangest of times."
{w

{c
In the wake of our experiments with the scroll, the Tripower Empire,
under the instrumentality of the organization known as Nytek, was
busy with experiments of their own, many involving the meld of magic
and technology. I had a side interest in their progress, namely in
the field of airship mechanics. On one of my "information gathering"
trips to Torregiano, I met someone who I could only describe as odd.
{w
A tall man, with copper hair and green eyes and a little pet ferret
walked into the bar where I sat that evening. He wore a strange shield
and belt, and carried an even stranger staff. His markings were
familiar, but at the same time, very different for this part of the
world.  I could tell that he wasnt from these parts.  
{w
I remember getting a bit inebriated and having a conversation with
him, namely about airships and travels to the west.  That was where
the conversation seemed to steer itself.  He was very much fascinated
with airship travel, and we talked and drank the night away. He was
one hell of a drinker to keep up with, which is another reason I knew
him to not be from these parts.  Gaolong was with me, drunk as ever,
and kept himself busy with chasing the ferret around trying to eat it.
Ramus was also there, though he didnt care much for conversation.  He
just sat in the corner with his bottle.  
{w
I recall fixing my eyes upon the orb at the end of his staff, which
seemed to beckon me. When I drew near, it glowed with an intense green,
and I amused myself with this for several minutes. The glow made me
giggle.  
{w
I thought nothing of it, and staggered home to bed. Turning out the
lights, I remember an intense green haze had filled my bedchambers
and made it very difficult to get some shuteye. {m"Damn magical lights
messing with me at night!" {wI cursed, only later having the sense to
see that it was that scroll glowing in my half-open bag. 
{c
Somehow, that stranger enchanted the scroll to the point that when I
opened it, it was like opening a familiar book. I saw clearly the
spindles of a spell which could reach into the recesses of the mind,
endowing powerful knowledge to any source the caster chose to direct
it. Needless to say, I didn't sleep the rest of the night.
{w
Instead I sat up thinking about this strange man in Torregiano. Was
he of some higher power, perhaps blessed by the gods, or an immortal
himself? Or was he just a man from a place far more developed than
ours? I sketched the markings from his armor and dug in my archive
for answers. It took perhaps an hour to find a small book with similar
markings. This particular book was given to me by Grandal. He found it
in the High Tower of Sorcery along with an amulet, which I now recall
as bearing that same design. All signs pointed to his lineage as
coming from the Great Wizard's Council.  It was plausible that he
could have unlocked such an ancient spell with ease (enough that he
didn't even realize it). 
{M
"And that is where I left off shortly before returning to my
bedchambers with the scroll" {wI remarked to Bosch, who passively
turned his head from side to side, which meant he was listening
intently. {M"I mustered up some courage, shrugged off the voice of
reason and read from the scroll. It caught afire in my hands, a
bright green one, and sent me reeling across the room with the
force of a hundred ton sledge. I gathered enough strength to crawl
upon my bed, and then there was darkness..."

"So it was all a trick!  We were taken in by a millennia old
trick!" {wBosch remarked, half laughing, half in awe. {M "Yes, I can
still hear them laughing" {wI replied, gesturing toward my head. {M"I
upset some delicate balance, and the avalanche came down upon me!"
{w
For a moment, we sat in the bakery and mused about this, not quite
sure what to say, and then I laughed.  Then he laughed, and we had
a good time out of it in the end. I finally intervened for our
sanity:  {M"So back to you again. How the hell did you manage this
faction?"   
{C
"When you did not return, I set the plan in motion, mustering up
the supporters of our faction and petitioning the Tripower for our
cause. And then we waited and hoped you would come back, but set
about the plan as usual.  Interest died down, but it was not
forgotten. This week we have won two great victories:  our faction
and your return.  We have the official word:  Myth Drannor is in
our protection."
{w
I nodded, and found the words to reply, "There are a lot of things
to do now." I remarked.  {M"We have to round up our support and
organize our cause. We cannot do this alone-."
{C
"In due time, Clausius." {whe said, smiling.  {C"Answers will present
themselves, for now we have much catching up to do.  Come, lets
have a drink.  I brought some homebrew that'll make slap your mama!"
{w
I nodded at the truth he spoke. There was much that I had to catch
up with, and for several hours we did, and others joined us,
friends and acquaintances from long ago...you know who you are for
you were there.
{w
Just before returning to my home, Bosch stopped me outside in
Market Square, {C"One thing bothers me about your side of the story.
If you upset some delicate balance set up within the scroll, and
only bad things manifested, then where is the good of it all?  Did
you ever attain the knowledge that was promised?"

I smiled, for it was all I could do.  Then I turned toward him and
tapped my brow with my finger, {M"In due time, old friend, for

fall~
{CThe Fall of Netheril:
{c
 The hubris of its greatest mages was the downfall of the magocracy of
Netheril.  Karsus having grown so powerful that he believed himself the
equal of a god took it upon himself to take Mystral's power and godhood.
This itself caused such a disturbance in the weave that magic ceased to
exist for a moment, long enough for the Mythallar to fail completely
and the flying cities of the Netheril to fall to the ground causing
a disaster of apocalyptic proportions for the Netherese both above and
below.  Mystral's power was transferred to Mystra and magic was restored
even though it remained unstable for many years afterward.
{c
 Fortunately not all of the magics of the Netheril were completely lost
forever as a good sampling were moved to the shadow realm with the
last of the Netherese cities.  I have personally been trying to determine
a way to get there to study the working magics of the city of shade.
Thus far the only way I have found is through the Shadow Temples, and
I have only just found rumors and such of those.  It was a sad day
for mages everywhere when Netheril fell.  it locked away much that could
have been of use today.
{c
 There are still Netherese peoples in the realms scattered to the winds.
Most notably A fabled wizard king of one of the floating Netherese cities.
The Shadow King now resides in his lair surrounded by lesser liches as well
as other forms of undead.  While not necessarily evil he is quite insane
and is thus an unreliable source of information even if one were able to
come into contact with him.

mythallar~
{CThe Mythallar:
{c
 The Mythallar were created by the Netherese in order to power not only
their floating mountain cities, but also as a means of making normal items
into quasi-magical items.  An example would be a candelabra that could
give off light without fire.  The floating cities of the magocracy were 
full of these sorts of items.  The items themselves outside of the
influence of the Mythallar acted as their normal counterparts.
{c
 The Mythallar of the Netherese were constructed as 150 foot wide perfectly
round spheres.  The material appears to be crystalline in structure and gives
off a bright light.  The surface of a working Mythallar appears to have
shadows that pass across the surface.
{c
 The theory behind the operation of the Mythallar is that the item post
creation taps directly into the raw untempered magic of the weave itself.
The item then takes this and projects a field of usable magic around the
Mythallar that can be accessed by objects and people within its sphere of
influence.  The Range of influence of the Netherese mythallar was one mile
from the surface of the sphere in all directions, there is speculation as
to the necessity of the size of these Mythallar, but the size may have
been necessitated by the uses they were being put through as well as the
size of the Netherese cities.
{c
 Due to Karsus's folly, which will be explained in another chapter, all
but one Mythallar was destroyed, the one surviving artifact was transported
into the shadow realm shortly before Karsus made his fatal mistake.  An
operating Mythallar has not been seen in Faerun since.

scrolls~
{CThe Nether Scrolls:
{x
{c Almost an entire volume could be written on the Nether Scrolls and their
uses.  However, I will attempt to condense the important parts into this
chapter as it pertains to the Netherese.
{x
{c The Nether Scrolls were crafted by a people called the Sarrukh, a serpentine
race that was one of the five "creator" races that existed at approximately
-35000 DR.  Though these creatures still exist today, their numbers are
limited and their true influence can be found in the races they helped to
create.  The Sarrukh themselves were snakelike humanoid creatures with
vast arcane powers.
{x
{c The Sarrukh in an attempt to consolidate all of their arcane knowledge in
one place created the Nether scrolls.  These scrolls are a set of 50 sheets
of metal reportedly having runes and writings that swirl in and out of focus
across the surface.  The scrolls used in order reveal arcane knowledge to
the reader.  Also, each time the scrolls are read they reveal new information
seemingly at random.  The nature of what is learned is uncontrollable with
the scrolls in their true form.  Later the elves of Myth Drannor were able
to find a way to control the scrolls and direct the learning that could be
gotten from the scrolls.
{x
{c The Netherese had these scrolls in their possession for many centuries
through their progress in learning magic.  The highest of the Netherese
society spent their lives furthering their magical knowledge by repeatedly
studying these scrolls
{x
{c As the ruining of Myth Drannor has erased much of the historical data 
regarding time frames of certain events it is unknown when the elven mages
of Drannor acquired the full set of the nether scrolls.  They melted down
and formed the scrolls into the shape of a tree.  Due to this shaping the
user was able to control what they learned about from different parts of
the tree.  Beyond this the information is lost and eventually the tree
was destroyed and its parts scattered.  The location of the now reformed
Nether Scrolls is currently unknown though it can be assumed that they are
scattered to the far corners of faerun, and without all of the scrolls their
use is severely limited.

E
culture~
{CCulture:
{x
{c Within netheril culture at its height there was a split between the two
types of people, those who had magic and those that did not.  Those that
had the use of magic lived on enormous floating cities created by using
magic to cut a mountain off at its base and flipping it over in the air.
This one feat displays the true power that was the Netherese magocracy.
These floating islands were then powered in turn by the Mythallar, an item
that allows common items within its sphere of influence to become magical
items.  I will detail the Mythallar in a separate chapter.
{x
{c The "have not's" lived on the lands below the floating mountains mostly
farmers and craftsmen supplying the mages in the cities above.  The mages of
netheril lived to increase their knowledge of the arcane and in this pursuit
even traveled to other planes of existence as a routine practice.
{x
{c The speed at which the Netherese power increased created a overconfidence
in its superiority and invulnerability.  The prime example of this being
Karsus's Folly which again will be detailed in a later chapter.

beginnings~
{CBeginnings:
{x
{c The Netheril society was originally an alliance of small farming villages
bonded together as means of protection from outside threats.  This would
be one of the longest lasting empires in the history of the human race as
in small areas and small groups it still exists even today.
{x
{c The elves of the region watched these humans build their empire for many
years from a distance, marking their progress as a civilization.  As the
new human empire grew the elves approached the leaders of these Netherese
with knowledge and some limited magic.  This started a partnership that
would last for hundreds of years and maintain a peace between the races.
{x
{c The single event that lead to the downfall of the Netherese was the
discovery of the nether scrolls in the ruins of Aryvandaar, the ruins of
an ancient sun elf city.  These scrolls arguably increased the knowledge
of the netherese wizards one hundredfold in unnaturally short time.  The
functions and purpose of the nether scrolls is something I shall cover
in later chapters.

introduction~
{CIntroduction{c:
{c
{c The Rilmani as a recently discovered extra planar race have only recently been
contacted by a few amongst the peoples of Faerun.  We as a group dedicated to
the maintenance of the balance within the world have had the distinct pleasure
of direct exposure to these beings so dedicated to the complete balance on a
scale that extends to the entirety of all planes of existence.  It is a huge
honor to have these metallic skinned creatures as advisors in our ever constant
vigil over the flux of power in our world.  Coincidentally the demon infested
areas of Cormanthor have enabled the Rilmani to cross between their world and 
ours almost at will to assist us and provide their support.
{c
{c The purpose of the Rilmani is both simple and complex as it relates to our
plane of existence.  We as the Keepers view the balance on a scale relative
to Toril, where the Rilmani view it on a scale of the entirety of reality,
including all planes of existence.
{c
{c The Rilmani view things on a scale that includes the demonic forces of the
hells as well as the angelic forces on other planes of existence.  These forces
are in an eternal war over our (prime material) plane of existence.  They 
take advantage of anything available to gain an advantage in our world and all
others, and each plane lost to the imbalance good or evil is a blow to the
stability of our own lives.
{c
{c In further chapters I shall discuss the purposes and types of the Rilmani,
as they have been an invaluable resource to my and others research into
methods of controlling and counteracting the influences of both good and
evil in our world.

aurumach~
{CThe Aurumach{c:
{c
{c The Aurumach are the elite of the Rilmani, the most powerful and the most
focused.  Their goal is to be the advisors of all existence.  They go where 
their help is needed most in keeping the balance of all things.  The prime 
material plane is a major focus of the higher Rilmani due to our integral
part in the overall balance of good and evil.
{c
{c The Aurumach are considered the leaders of the Rilmani society and all
bend to their will.  A command from an Aurumach is all that matter to all 
lower Rilmani and will be carried out regardless of the consequences to the 
carrier of the orders.
{c
{c The Aurumach appear as relatively humanoid creatures with the only difference
being the metallic sheen to their skin and the pulsating light that is their
eyes.  at a distance it would be difficult to determine a difference between
a human and a high Rilmani but at close range the eyes give away the creatures
origin every time.

argenach~
{CThe Argenach{c:
{c
{c These Rilmani appear to be the advisors of the Rilmani.  The first wave sent in
on any mission to maintain the balance.  They act as a warning to the material
plane that something is wrong, that we as mortals are missing something important.
They find those that sit in the middle lines of events and advise, whisper, or
subvert as is necessary to achieve the end goal of allowing no side to come out ahead.
{c
{c The Argenach are the slightest of build of all Rilmani, always playing a non
combative role in the events of the worlds.  Their metallic skin and luminous 
eyes are immediate giveaways to those who are unaccustomed to their 
appearances.  Rudimentary study of the Rilmani and their appearances has shown that
they are resistant to electricity  in the form of lightning though magically rendered
lightning has been obviously untested.

abiorach~
{CThe Abiorach{c:
{c
{c The Abiorach appear approximately the same size as an adolescent human with
the strength of many of the strongest of humans behind them.  Their skin
is a silvery color that shimmers in the light.  Abiorach act as spies within
the elemental planes as their natural abilities are very advantageous in these
circumstances.
{c
{c Abiorach have the ability to attune to the elemental plane they are currently
inhabiting, becoming completely immune to the element of that plane and gaining
most of the attributes of the home world elementals.  For example, an Abiorach
on the elemental plane of fire would become completely immune to the effects of
fire and would be completely accepted by the local denizens.
{c
{c Abiorach typically travel in groups while in the elemental planes with the
most experienced among the group acting as a sort of leader.  This is mostly
a loose organization as these Rilmani tend to view things from an elemental's
view rather than that of a human.

{CThe Cuprilach{c:
{c
{c The Cuprilach are much slighter of build than most of their fellow Rilmani.
Their stature is very similar to that of an elf though they pack incredible
strength in with their agility.  The biggest tell on these creatures origins
is in their coppery metallic looking skin.  These Rilmani are the assassins
and spies of the Spire.  They pride themselves in their prowess, reportedly
this is not an undeserved pride as there has never been a report of a Cuprilach 
failing at their task.
{c
{c The other Rilmani only barely trust the Cuprilach with anything more than
the tasks they are given as a Cuprilach never denies a mark.  They are by far
the most militant of their race believing that striking first at beings of
extreme evil and good is the way to maintain the balance.  Cuprilach are not
above using any and all dirty tricks to complete a task once given.

{CThe Ferrumach:

{c The warrior class of the Rilmani, these people appear as enormous humans with
Broad well muscled chests and arms and les the size of the average person's
waist.  Their skin is a dull grey that shines like iron in the light.  These
Rilmani serve no other purpose other than as soldiers and prefer life this way.
{c
{c The Ferrumach do not mingle with other Rilmani with he exception of the
occasional Cuprilach whom they respect as professionals and fellow fighters.
They wait for battle in their halls that surround their outlands spire in 
a state of constant vigilance.
{c
{c The preferred weapons of the Ferrumach seems to be Two handed axes and
pole arms and they wear incredibly heavy and spiked plate armor.  Even
the strongest of humans would not be able to move in the armor I have

plumach~
{CThe Plumach{c:
{c
{c The Plumach are the craftsmen of the Rilmani.  They are short barrel chested
creatures heavily resembling Dwarves with the exception being their metallic 
grey skin.  They are very much isolationists in that they just want people
to mind their own business and tend to not act on anything beyond their own
home plane and cities.  Though when forced into a fight they can still hold
their own in combat.
{c
{c The Plumach pride themselves in their craftsmanship as they have plenty
of time to perfect it given the Rilmani's lack of need for food or sleep.
The Plumach spend their time perfecting objects of comfort and entertainment
for the other Rilmani and themselves.

{c Within the Keepers we have three sects each covering certain
aspects of life that need to be watched.  The mind, the 
physical, and the arcane.  We, the Circle of the Attuned, 
monitor and correct imbalances in the arcane aspects of life.  
{c
 Those of the circle are comprised of wizards, priests, and 
sages, though we accept all who wish to assist in our watching 
as all skills are important when watching those who would abuse 
the weave or their divine powers.  
{c
 Part of watching balance with the arcane is keeping records 
of past mistakes.  Events like the destruction of Cormanthor at
the hands of the demons may have been prevented had the correct
knowledge existed at the time.  It is our job to watch for signs
that magics are in the works that could cause similar destruction.
{c
 We of the circle also rely heavily upon the Sphere of the Mind
and the Order of the Sword in our work.  The Sphere are the 
record keepers of the realms, they collect intelligence and 
document it in the libraries of the Keepers.  The Order of the 
Sword is the strong arm of the Keepers.  They are the enforcers 
of the will of the clan, acting on imballances when necessary.
{c
 This structure is very similar to that of the Rilmani who have 
been our partners in this undertaking.  The jobs within the 
Rilmani are separated according to the different types of Rilmani
in their social structure.  The difference lying in that all 
sects within the Keepers are equal with none above the other, 
thus as we watch the world, so do we watch eachother.  {x

smattering of lichen and moss, while the ground is hidden by the
undergrowth of fern and fallen leaves.  A small path winds through
the trunks.{x

A Path along the Hills~
~
{x
{gThe small path through the hills brushes by the tall grasses 
{gand wildflowers that dot the landscape.  Toward the east is 
the edge of the island, while to the west one can see the castle
of the Keepers of Balance rising high into the sky.  Gentle
breezes blow, setting the hillsides swaying with the movement of
grass.{x

Along the Cliff Edge~
~
{x
{gThe hillside path opens to a stunning view of the realms.  Far
{gbelow, the Haon'Dor Forest spreads, and farther east is a glimpse
of Westbridge.  One can stand right on the edge of the floating
island, looking over a very sheer drop down, or retreat back
among the hills and the wildflowers and grasses.{x

Along the Cliff Edge~
~
{x
{gThe hills rise ever higher, straddling the openness of the air
to the east, and the rolling hills to the west.  Wildflowers
grow alongside tall grasses the sway in the gentle breezes
that blow along the cliffsides.  The view grows ever more stun-
ning the further up the hill one climbs.{x
