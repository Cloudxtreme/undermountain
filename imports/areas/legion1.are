{*Alson{x~
{8Alson{c, the {Ywealthiest {8most {Rpowerful {WFairfax{8ian{x
~
{cYou see an entity of {8Darkness{c.  After batting your eyelashes and
rubbing your eyes a bit, you conclude it is not a figmentation and
begin to examine it....  It is a silhouette of a male figure
contrieved mainly of muscle with few physical flaws.  You denote he is
a titan by build, but his height of 6ft leads you to beleive he is a
saiyan.  There is a sheet flowing from his head that is either his {8jet
black hair{c, or a hood of {8black satin{c.  Aside from these details, the
darkness engulfs every other single detail you attempt to depict. 
Suddenly, he begins to turn and you are instantly entranced by the
sight of his eyes which glisten in a dull {Wgrey{c color and pupils of
{mpurple{c and {8black s{mw{8i{mr{8l{me{8d{c colors.  His eyes slowly close and as you
blink (in hopes that you can catch another glipse of his unique eyes)
you notice the entire shadowy entity is gone.  Again batting your
eyelashes the thought of yourself halucinating rekindles in your mind.

Subject: Declaring Citizens/NonCitizens Wanted
+--------------------------------------------+
The TriPower Wishes To Explain On The Rules and
Regulation of declaring people Wanted by the
public. A person should only be wanted when
he breaks one of the laws of the TriPower.
This includes Attacking/Killing Other players
(this is done AUTOMATICALLY and only AUTO),
Stealing from players (I think this is auto
too, maybe not), healing those who are engaged
in a fight with a Legion or OOJ Officer, or if
they are involved in a jail break.

half of the walls are lined with glass cases.  As you peer into the
cases all you see rows and rows of voodoo dolls, each with a name tag
attached to it.  You would say there are over 1000 dolls in the cases,
and each doll is unique.  You wonder how one man could have
acomplished so much and still be alive.

Inside this vast study room, you find no one is in here.  A large
desk sits in the middle of the room.  A pair of boxes reading "In" and
"Out" rests at the end of the desk, and are filled with papers.  The
walls are covered with posters, banners, and paintings.  In front of
the desk you see two chairs, and behind the desk a large leather
chair.  The rest of the room is filled with hobbyist toys such as
moogle guns, telescopes, scrolls, and pieces of the RoK.

You stand towards the end of Military Lane, to the east is the
opening to the air field.  To the north, another large brick building
stands, a few scientists stand outside, smoking a cigarette.  Some
green smoke seems to be leaking out of all the windows on the
building, and you notice the sign on the building..."  Legion Magic &
Technology Research".  To the south you see there is no building, but
a large lot, encircled by a large brick wall.  The testing area.  The
air field stands to your east, and the rest of the base stands to your
west.

You walk into a large open building.  Inside, the whole bottom
floor of the building is totally open.  Long tables fill the floor,
which contain diffrent vials and beakers, and glass tubes with strange
off color liquid in them.  Large work benches line the walls, filled
with metal objects and mechanical machinery.  The Legion Machine and
Research Shop is both used for the army, it the empire.  Men and Women
in white coats walk around with clip boards, studing and looking over
at the other type of people in here, the grease monkey.  A few men
stand at the machine work benches, and they look somewhat
unintelligent, but they are wizards of machinery.

You stand inside Legion Airship Hangar Number One.  The building is
large, and almost empty, except for the airship in it.  Before you
stands a large iron whale, an modern airship made from nothing but
metal and engine, unlike its older version of the sailing ships using
a makou gas blimp to float, and engines to propell itself.  The ship
is long, and built from large iron plates.  Two large engines sit in
the middle on either side.  Below that area, a fin comes down which
contains the actual airship.  From the large fin, a large crank shaft
extends to the rear, three two sided blades extend from that.  From
the main body of the ship, two tails extend back, which hold a large
eray of fins in a box shape.  Two tail fins extend upwards from the
rear of the airship.  You take notice on the main part of the body, a
painting of a woman in a red dress.

scattered about the roadway.  A short ways to the north is the {YG{yriffon
