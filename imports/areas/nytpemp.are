a ugly little creature~
This pitiful specimen of the goblin race sits here, busily working away at nothing.
~
This tiny goblin-like creature sits here by his fire in-between his
trips to raid the countryside.  Perhaps he is merely poor, or maybe he
is one of the robbers of the worst type that seem to be plaguing the
lands.

Though the deck itself is mostly sealed with blast doors, the residency
deck still keeps a quaint atmosphere to it as workers walk to and about
the various rooms and halls.  Each hall is a tetrad formation, like a
sort of pyramidical structure.  The halls are illuminated by poly-light
globes located intermittently throughout the area.

The Shores of the Sands of Sorrow~
~

coarse, golden sands of the desert merge with the gray sands of the shore,
creating an interesting mosaiic.

The Arc of the Diamond Sea~
~
The mountains before you almost seem to be harvesting the intense heat
from the Desert of the Elemental Canyon.  The sands here radiate heat, and
have a coarse, almost rough texture.  The entire canyon seems to shimmer
with an almost magical glow.
