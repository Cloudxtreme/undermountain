of Nordahaeril. To the east a set of spiral stairs leads down to the

Overhead an elegant  chandelier hangs from the ceiling.  To the north
side of the room  is a wooden bar that  looks like it has  grown from
the very  floor it resides on. Knotted stools sit around the front of
the bar. An unusual fireplace is nestled off to one side. To the west
behind the bar is a darkened hallway, and south is the exit.{x

the  rafters. Some  sagging seems  to have occurred over time.  Walls
are bare  of  any  decoration  save  one  single  portrait.  A  small
fireplace doubles as a  cooking stove off to one corner. The floor is
that of  the forest floor, simply dirt. Knots of tree  roots protrude
from the ground  in several places.  A door to the  south leads  back
out, and that seems to be the only exit.{x
