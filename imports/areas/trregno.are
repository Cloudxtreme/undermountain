Mr. Target, a test dummy, is posted near the road.

This is a dummy of a large human.  It looks like it has taken quite a
beating and been reassembled many times.  Yet, despite the knicks and
burns, it stands very resilient.  Though it stands immobile, something
about it seems extremely dangerous.

detailed form of a gigantic knight in shining, rune-encrusted armor.  The
great-axe which the knight is holding is a work of art of and unto itself. 
This great creation is sculpted of what looks to be ice magically sustained

gytokich~
Annoyed the IMMs with notes asking and lobbying for immortalship,
nochanneled and noposted, created the character CoolGuy resulting in
his IP address being newbie banned. Continued to malign the Waterdeep
Staff and was removed from play and placed on a cross for all to see,
and learn from his mistakes.

cross bean~
Bean's twisted and bloated corpse hangs from a cross, lifeless.  His
face is painted like a clown, and his privates have been removed with
something that apparently looked red hot.  Bean has a pboard history of
luring NPK players into dangerous situations, despite the NPK players
falling for his tricks, the staff of Waterdeep does not like Bean's ways
of trying to bend the rules.  So thus, fuck you Bean, your character is GONE.
Breath another fucking pboard onto any other character, and you will be banned.

HOW TO USE THE TAXI SERVICE IN TORREGIANO.
All you need to do is locate one of the Taxi Mobs running around the city.
They all hold a map of the city, and key locations you can pay to go to.
Below you will find that same map, and you just give the taxi the amount
of gold that the location costs.

lifestealer~
As you look at this dagger, your eyes defocus and suddenly you are
looking beyond the surface.  Strange, malevolent patterns of greys and
blacks swirl sickeningly, and at the edge of perception comes a strange,
mocking laughter that could originate from no mortal throat.  Suddenly, you
are falling through nothingness...  Falling...  Falling...  Sensation
returns as you land on a surface.  You look at yourself, and see that your
regular armor has disapeared in favor of a strange black suit with spikes on
every surface.  You look around yourself, and see a surface extending to
infinity on every side.  A roar comes.  Turning, you see an army in
light-absorbing armor awaiting your command.  As they roar again and again,
dreams of power and wealth untold fill your head.  Each roar is becoming
louder now, and closer together.  It becomes one continuous roar,
overwhelming your senses as you are swallowed by a seemingly solid mass of
sound...  And just as suddenly as this whole vision began, you are back in
the mortal realms, in your own armor, looking at the matte black surface of
an enigmatic dagger.

are falling through nothingness...  Falling...  Falling...  Sensation
returns as you land on a surface.  You look at yourself, and see that your
regular armor has disapeared in favor of a strange black suit with spikes on
every surface.  You look around yourself, and see a surface extending to
infinity on every side.  A roar comes.  Turning, you see an army in
light-absorbing armor awaiting your command.  As they roar again and again,
dreams of power and wealth untold fill your head.  Each roar is becoming
louder now, and closer together.  It becomes one continuous roar,
overwhelming your senses as you are swallowed by a seemingly solid mass of
sound...  And just as suddenly as this whole vision began, you are back in
the mortal realms, in your own armor, looking at the matte black surface of
an enigmatic dagger.

champs~
Je m'baladais sur l'avenue, le coeur ouvert a l'inconnu. 
J'a vais envie de dire bonjour a n'importe qui 
N'importe qui et ce fut toi, je t'ai dit n'importe quoi, 
Il suffisait de te parler, pour t'apprivoiser. 
 
Aux Champs-lyses, aux Champs-lyses 
Au soleil, sous la pluie, a midi ou a minuit, 
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-lyses 
 
Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendez-vous dans un sous-sol avec des fous, 
Qui vivent la guitare a la main, du soir au matin". 
Alors je t'ai accompagne, on a chant, on a dans 
Et l'on n'a mme pas pens -- a s'embrasser 
 
Aux Champs-lyses, aux Champs-lyses 
Au soleil, sous la pluie, a midi ou a minuit, 
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-lyses 
  
 
(English Translation for those of you who dont speak french)
I was walking (strolling) on the avenue,the heart opened to the unknown  
I wanted to say hello to anyone 
Anyone and that was you,I told you anything, 
Just hadda talk to you,to tame (win over) you. 
 
On the ChampsElyses,on the ChampsElyses 
Under the sun,under the rain,at midday or midnight,  
There's whatever you want on the ChampsElyses  
You said"I have rendez vous in a basement(underground) 
with mad(crazy)guys who live with guitar in the hand, 
from evening til' morning  
So,I've accompanied you (came with you),we sang,we danced  
And we even not thought about kissin'(embracin')  
 
On the ChampsElyses,on the ChampsElyses  
Under the sun,under the rain,at midday or midnight,  
There's whatever you want on the ChampsElyses

love~
Blast oxygen masks, smoke filled cabin 
Depressurize, don't be afraid, hold onto me 
We're goin down, but not our love 
 
Death don't seem so bad, 'cause I'm with you 
My only love, so close your eyes 
Kiss me one last time, We're gonna 
Die, but not our love, not our love

me I can't breathe that's why I love her yeah, I'm her butter she's my  
bread she's like mobile waterbed but when I get on top of her I can't  
touch the mattress And when her flesh begins to sag she's like a human  
sleeping bag I feel so cozy safe and worthy she's my insulation I always  
know where she sat and when she's on me I get flat some broken ribs a  
punctured lung that's why I love her She's my phillie, I'm her stud her

it you need someone to blame I'll say I said it cause whatever  
Didi wants, she's gonna get it I wouldn't climb the highest mountain  
could get a blister, but almost anything I wouldn't throw coins  
in a fountain I might be needing to make a phone call

linoleum~
possessions never meant anything to me 
i'm not crazy ('cause i've got none) 
we'll that's not true, i've got a bed and a guitar 
and a dog named dog who pisses on my floor 
that's right, i've got a floor 
so what, so what, so what? 
I've got pocket full of kleenex and lint and holes 
where everything important to me  
just seems to fall right down my leg 
and on the floor 
my closest friend, linoleum 
linoleum 
supports my head, gives me something to believe 
that's me on the beachside combing the sand 
metal meter in my hand 
sporting a pocket full change 
that's me on the street with a violin under my chin 
playing with a grin, singing gibberish 
that's me on the back of the bus 
that's me in the cell 
that's me inside your head 
that's me inside your head

alone~
breath ever so soft 
we wouldn't wanna break the eggs as we walk 
never alone, cautious, afraid 
I hear the voice of reason on the p.a. 
leave it alone, follow the grain 
we couldn't stop the irresistible force 
leave it the same, change with he leaves 
bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the old 
leave it alone 
da na na na na na na na 
da na na na na na na na 
da na na na na na na na 
da na na na na na na na 
breath, ever so slight 
we couldn't take away your god given right 
leave it alone, heel and stay 
roll over and shake and beg for the bone 
leave it alone 
da na na na na na na na

da na na na na na na na

punkguy~
crazier than GG, yet more pc than ian 
got colored teeth like johnny 
exudes a vicious disposition 
his hair sticks out like colins did, he jumps 
similar to springa, he points his middle finga 
not just the singer in the band 
voted biggest asshole and role model of the year 
got a face like charles bronson 
straight outta green bay wisconsin 
not just a singer in the band 
he'll puke on you, he'll fuck your mom, he'll smoke 
while huffing gas 
he was the punkest mother fucker I ever did see 
hell he was even more punk than me 
he should've been on the cover 
he should've been on the cover 
he should've been on the cover of punk and disorderly

"what were you thinkin 'bout?" bob said, "that's just the point, I  
wasn't thinkin bout nothing now I gotta do something else to pass  
the time." had someone shave his head got a new identity sixty-two  
holed air cushioned boots and a girl who rides a scooter to take him  
out of town they could get away riding around, as the trucks drive by  
you could hear the mother truckers go . . . a couple of lines, an extra  
thermos of Joe he'll be kickin in heads at the punk rock show, yeah  
bob's the kinda guy who knows just bob's the kinda guy who knows  
just what to do when the doctor tells him to "quit you drinkin,  
now's the time." will he ever walk the line? will he ever walk  
the line? to all my friends, I fell just great but will he ever walk  
the line? kickin ass and bustin heads red suspenders once a day   
he shaves his head but will he ever walk the line?

louise~
liza's had enough of men she says, she won't get burned again  
she says, they don't know how to fuck her last boyfriend, the shmuck  
shared with her a nice disease kept her passive, on her knees 'til  
one day she took his car and drove it to the city liza had put down  
a few when she met this girl named lou who convinced her to go  
home with her she said, "my name's louise now will you take your  
clothes off please? I want to take you to the moon and back so get  
on your back." with a flick of the tongue she made her scream she  
made her laugh she made her dance she was happy for the first time  
and you know she wanted more now with her legs spread wider she  
needed to have louise inside her she said, "I'll never forget the first  
time you kissed me, now I want you to fist me." louise didn't need a  
second invitation she knew just what to do she knew just what to do  
liza had cum a few times before but she had never even seen the door  
into the world of pleasures of the flesh she felt just like 16 and her life  
before now was a dream or even a nightmare thats over and done just

radio~
we wrote this song, it's not too short, not too long it's got back-up  
voc's in just the right places it's got a few oohs and ahhs it takes  
a little pause just before the second chorus please play this song  
on the radio almost every line is sung in time almost every verse  
ends in a rhyme the only problem we had was writing enough words  
but that's okay, because the chorus is coming up again now please  
play this song on the radio please play this song on the radio

elite~
Indiscriminate I'd rather be elite 
I'll choose my own shit scene 
Unsubstantiated rumors flown are true 
Nonconglumurate I mean what I say 
I'm not your fucking scape 
Goat apparently I've alienated some 
It seems my job's half done 
You'll never understand it 
Try to buy and brand it 
I win, you lose, cause it's my job 
To keep punk rock elite 
This music ain't your fuckin' industry

{x  Airship speed varies from airship to airship, and depends on the size of the
{xengine.  Airship Engines are not just for show, the bigger the engine, the faster
{xyour airship will move.  The above graph displays the time trials for all current
{xairship models, along with all available and soon to be available engine sizes,
{xwith the exception of the "XF" Model, which is just an experimental engine to see
{xthe max speed of all airships.  These times were taken by racing each of the
{xdifferent airship down a 20 room stretch.  The time shown, will show how long it
{xtakes an airship to move 20 rooms on the map.  5 Seconds is the fastest an airship
{xcan move in this system.  The actual weight of the airship object determines how
{xfast the airship can move, in the bottom right box is the weight of each airship
{xmodel.
{x
{x  Please also take note that the smaller ships max out with certain engine
{xsizes, meaning such as the Hammerhead does not need an engine bigger than
{xthe 10 pistons.

This large building located on the corner of Main Street & Shire
has always been a home to the Fishermen and Dock Workers who dwell
below in the Torregiano Sea-Port.  After a long day or night worth of
working, most workers find it relaxing to drop by the old Burning
Dwarf and kick back a few with their fellow co-workers.  The bar is
dark and made from deeply stained oak wood.  The bar runs along the
western wall, behind it a shelf filled all sorts of booze and spirits.
A large mirror helps reflect the alcohol and allows people sitting at
the bar, to see the activities in the main room.  The main floor is
filled with small round tables, each with a burning candle.  To the
northern side raised above the main floor is the pool table area with
several tables ready to be played.  A makou power jukebox sits behind
the tables.  The walls are covered with pictures from the city of
Torregiano, many of them showing scenes of construction work, such as
the Legionaire Harbor Bridge, Tripower Tower and the Makou Cannon
Support Structures.  Alot of memories have been made here, and alot of
broken hearts.

| Rooms  : 48                  |  Battle Cruisers are massive ships designed   |
| Weapons: 6 Cannons [Crewed]  |mainly for large crews and battles.  They are  |
| Engines: 4 Drive Engines     |the largest of 'public' airships and feature   |
|          6 Lift Engines      |almost the largest amount of weapons available.|
| Weight : 32,000 Pounds       |                                               |

| Weapons: 2 Cannons           |the single seaters, holding the least motors   |
| Engines: 2 Drive Engines     |and cannons.  They are small and cramped but   |

| Rooms  : 31                  |  Juggernaughts are heavier warships than the  |
| Weapons: 7 Cannons [Crewed]  |Battle and War Cruisers, holding the most      |
| Engines: 2 Drive Engines     |cannons out of all public airships.  Like any  |

|  Hulls can have their 'material' upgraded after purchase.  This will increase|

|  The wooden hull is removed and replaced with the Iron Plated Hull, then     |
|  smaller iron tiles are added ontop of the plates for a scale like hull.     |
|                                                                              |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Crewed:  When this appears under Weapons, it means the airship is designed  |
|to be 'manned' by more than a single person, and the weapons are located in   |
|their own room, seperate from the helm.  Single Seater Airships are made for  |
|only a few passengers and their weapon controls are located at the helm.      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Floatation:  All airships use some type of device for floatation.  The lift |
|engines of an airship are used to change altitude and compensate for heavy    |
|cargo loads, while the floatation devices counter the initial weight of an    |
|airship.  A well floated airship should be liftable by a mere human.          |
|                                                                              |
| * Blimp  - Large balloon type structures made from raw canvas, but typically |
|has some sort of protective outter shell made from wood and or metal.         |
|                                                                              |
| * Tubing - A newer design in which pipes are outfitted to the framework of   |
|the airship.  They are filled with the same floatation gas and even though    |
|adds to the weight of the airship, have the same effect as blimp floaters.    |
|They are more ideal for battle as they are protected by the ships armor.      |
|                                                                              |
| * Magic  - In rare cases magic is used to float an airship, typically a type |
|of fly or levitation spell.                                                   |

{wThe {8Apothecary{w is a cozy and inviting {Wshop{w tucked away in the

brewed with care and confidence and fairly priced for all to make
use of.  He is new to {RT{rorregiano{w but quickly making a name for

The Cannon Control Room~
~
You stand in the control platform of "Stalin's Organ".  Straight
ahead of the platform, the awed, Makou Cannon stretches out over the
city of Torregiano.  The mass of the cannon makes you think, of the
power that is behind it.  The platform is made from scafalting and
grates.  To either side of you, large wires and cables go back into
the Tower Of The TriPower.  A large control panel stands, with many
buttons and lights.  You see four MAKOU REACTOR symboles there, with
lights under it spelling "Active" and another set saying "Connected". 
None of the lights are lit.  Next to it, you see another Makou Symbol,
this one has the words painted above it "Underground".  The lights
under that Symbol are lit.  All the meter lights across the board are
lit, and the power board is green.  Two large buttons sit next to a
large RED Button.  The button to the right says "On/Off".  The button
in the middle says "Fire", and the button to the left says "OverRide".

The Mountain Road~
~
The road here goes into the woods and towards the Northern Mountains. 
The road is made from cobblestone, and looks like it has been walked on for
many years.  Back to the east is Moria.  A sign by the road points to the
west, reading "Torregiano".

Balance around you.  The walls of Westbridge can been seen in the distance,
and the same with New Thalos.  Poking out of woods and clearings you can see
other landmarks, like the Holy Grove, The Dwarven Kingdom, and the two
towers in the western realms.  As the wind blows, a small of death hits your

The Torregiano Map Shop~
~
You stand in a large shop, filled with tiny little shelves.  In each
shelves, you see a rolled up peice of paper.  Welcome to the Torregiano Map
Shop, the main place to find a map you want.  Many maps fill the shop,
either in the little shelves or hanging on the wall.  The interior of the
shop is mainly these brown shelves.  The floor is made from hardwood, the
ceiling plaster, and from what you can see on the walls, they are grey.  You
see a guy sitting behind a counter drawing out a map.

The Mountain Road (Highest Point)~
~
This is the highest place on the mountain of Blaizer.  To the north a
valley appears, and the smell of salt water is in the air.  The sea of Istar
can be seen to the north, leading way from this Realm and going into The
Realms Of Vector, a hundred miles away.  To the northeast you can see the
walls of a very large city.  What seems to be floating above the city is a
large, round, long object.  In the center of a city a tower dwarfs the rest
of the buildings.  To the west, you see some trees, and a clearing.  A rough
sign hangs above the path to this clearing, the letters made from twigs and
branches.  The sign reads "Crucifition Hill".

road travels into the grassy Istar Plains towards the Elven Valley.
Southwards the road heads towards Blazier Mountain and the southern

surrounding the whole city.  In this corner a large building has been
built into the wall, making up the corner.  The sounds of machines
working echos here.  Above the building in the corner you see steam,
and a green glow within the steam.  A long road follows the outter
wall of Torregiano north, towards Port Judge.

{x  A large intersection opens up in the road, as one major roadway
crosses another.  Northwards only a short distance stands the giant
iron gates of the city of Torregiano, home of the Tripower Kingdom
and one of the most modern cities in Cruoris.  It stands on the
original fishmen town that was destroyed during the formation of the
Kingdom, the birthplace for freedom in the southern Vectorian lands.
Eastwards is the Red Steel Istar Roadway leading to Castle Red Steel,
a central meeting place for the eastern coast countries.  From that
Roadway the city of Zozo can also be travelled to.  Westwards is the
South Istar Roadway, following the coastline west towards the Elven
Valley, and northwards to the Vectorian Empire.  Makou City can also
be travelled to from this roadway, a once difficult city to access.

To the northwest is the city of Torregiano, the tall 20 foot

the southern end of the Istar Sea.  A few farms dot the landscape, and
directly in the east something can be seen.

The Elven Valley Roadway is really nothing more than a barely paved
cobblestone road.  This lightly used route travels through the wide
expanse of the Istar plains, covered mainly by naturally growing
golden wheat.  To the west, the cobblestones peter out into dirt. To
the east there is an intersection.

This is a small dirt road.  It is mainly formed by ruts from carriages
heading through the surrounding fields of wheat.  To the east, a cobble-
stone road leads off toward Torregiano.  To the west, the dirt road heads
deeper into the countryside where some type of barricade seems to block
the way.

of the Cannon Test Site.  As TriPower continues to develop the Makou Cannon,
they use this area as a testing ground.  The surrounding earth is all ripped
up and black from fire.  The wheat that normally grows has all been blasted
down.  To the east there is a small stone mound with a narrow, rectangular
window in the front. Further east can be seen a checkpoint of some kind
along the dirt road.  To the north, a grassy valley of some type opens up.

Its almost like an endless road, there is very little in the
surrounding area to break it up from looking like the rest of the
road.  The Istar Plains, also sometimes called the Torregiano Plains
is mainly made up of grass fields.  Much of it is left to grow wild,
with an occational farm cutting into the wilderness with well groomed
crop fields.  Southwards the Reaper Scythe Mountains stretch upwards
and block the southern view.  These mountains merge into the 'Central
Bowl' mountains that makes up the center of the Cruoris continent, and
can be seen westwards.  These mountains are much taller than the
Reaper Scythe, many of the peaks stretching far into the atmosphere,
and always snow covered.  The South Istar Roadway continues east
towards Torregiano, or west towards Makou City and the road to Vector.

This roadway was originally built the Vectorian Empire as part of
its continential network, in theory a person could walk these roadways
all the way to the Figaro Kingdom on the western coast, untold miles
away.  This road served as the main trade passage between what is
known as the Northern Vectorian Tier and Southern Vectorian Tier,
divided by the Reaper Scythe mountains to the south.  Together this
once made the entire Vectorian Empire until the sucession of the
Tripower Kingdom, which ruled over the entire Southern Tier for a
period of time.  Now they only rule over these grassy plains, while
the rest of the Southern Tier is ruled by the Factions.

The roadway has a strange sound when feet, wheels or anything
touches it.  Unlike cobble stone streets and other roadways, the
surface seems to be made of crushed white colored stone.  Its soft on
the feet, but at times needs to be smoothed out and graded, which can
be costly for the comfort.  Here and there some plants have managed to
grow in the stones, and yet again people must walk and pull the weeds
out, because sooner or later nature would reclaim this path.  The
white road can be seen for a long distance, travelling in a straight
line within the grassy plains of the Istar Sea.  Eastwards the city of
Torregiano can be seen, its massive walls julting upwards far above
the grass, or the massive cannon which sits above the city.  Westwards
the road heads towards the Vectorian Empire, and Makou City.

{x  An intersection opens up to the south in the South Istar Roadway, a
sign post points out possible places that can be travelled to from this
point.  Westwards the roadway continues to the Vectorian Corners, which
one can travel to the Vectorian Empire from there, or continue west to
the Elven Valley.  Eastwards is the Torregiano Corners, which the city
is only northwards, with Castle Red Steel and the city of Zozo east.
Southwards a road cuts through the grassy fields of the Istar Plains
into the Reaper Scythe Mountains that divides this region from the
civilization in the south.  The road leads to Makou City, an
underground mining city known to be home to Outlaws and Lawless people.
No major government rules over the people.  At one time this road did
not exist, and access to the city was only through the top of the
volcano it occupies, or through an underground river.

The Brewery Area (D)~
~
You stand in the working area of the Brewery.  All around you men walk,
with sacks and crates of ingredients.  To either side of you, very large
towers of booze stand, you see some of the men climbing up the stairs to it,
and dropping in the contents of the sacks.  The smell of oaks and barly is
very strong around here.  A door leads off to the east.

Brewery Workers Break Area~
~
You enter a smoked filled room, and no its not on fire.  Several workers
sit around a table, playing cards, and betting there wages.  Along the
walls, you see some others, sleeping on the benches or sitting, relaxing. 
The walls in here look like there where once white, but have a yellow look
to them.  You see a chart with names on it, and the days of the week.  On
another wall you see a poster for the factory, and next to it a punch clock.
A whistle blows, and some of the men stand up and leave, and some more men
come in, and sit down.  There are doors all around you.

The Torregiano Bluff~
~
You stand on top of the great mountain range, on a bluff,
overlooking the grass filled plains of the valley floor below.  In the
valley you can see the Istar see off in the distance, and the only
road to Vector.  To the far east, you see a few huts, and alot of
burnt ground.  Dotting the fields below are small farms and houses. 
To the far east you see a road going towards the Chain Islands.  Then
to the northeast, you see the work of Nisstyre, the greatest city in
the Great Realms, or at least some say.  Torregiano looms in the
distance, the sky above it seems to be darken, almost like Torregiano
was in eternal darkness.  In the four corners of the city, the large
Makou Reactors run, giving off a deep green glow over the whole city. 
Within the walls, the three support tracks of the great Makou Cannon
is very visable from here, and the TriPower Complex Tower.  You follow
the roads, tracing one back to the east through a mountain pass, and
into the road that is between Westbridge and New Thalos.  You see in
the middle of the mountain pass, construction of some sort going on. 
To the south, you take in the older land's view.  The Dwarven Kingdom,
Polaris, New Thalos, The Sands Of Sorrow, Westbridge, the Mages Tower,
the Wyrven tower, and all the other sites of what is know as "The Old
World".  To the north, the future, the "New World" stands before you.

You stand in the lobby of one of the shabbiest hostelries you have ever
seen.  The desk is littered with paper, and behind it stands a bruiser of a
man, looking decidedly unfriendly.  The security here, at least, is enough
to make this room (relatively!!!)  Safe from the crime outside, although not
enough to keep several homeless from bedding in the corners.  There is also
a shabby magician here, obviously hoping to use some of his skills in
healing to separate the local residents from their hard earned money.

This corridor is very shabby, but shows signs that it might not have been
that way forever.  Though greatly worn, the carpet shows traces that it was
once intricately died in rich colors.  Underneath the grime on the walls is
fine, although faded, wallpaper.  The only new things in this lobby are the
newly introduced Makou Gas lamps, and those show a flicker which is enough
to cause concern about a leak somewhere in the pipeline.  Guest rooms of
varying quality lay in every direction except up.

UGH!!!!  This is an incredibly dingy hotel room.  The first thing that

smell.  Next comes the poor lighting and the dirt on every surface... 
YUCK!!!  As the new arrival begins to become accustomed to the filth,
several other problems become apparent.  There is no window in this room,
and the bed looks almost less comfortable than the bare floor of this room.

This is a small and rather unpleasant room.  Although the lighting is
decent, it flickers from time to dime.  An unpleasant smell hovers at the
edge of perception, and the walls look to be in need of an immediate call
from the maid.  The window lets in only a moderate amount of light, and even
if the layer of grime covering it were to be removed, it would probably
offer a view only of the building next door.  The bed, at least, looks
moderately comfortable, and you should be able to get a pretty good night's
sleep in here by ignoring your surroundings.

This is a *small* but clean room.  The window admits welcome light and
fresh air into the room, and the walls tile and floors all look freshly
scrubbed.  The only thing detracting from this room is the lack OF room.  It
is hard to get to maneuver through the narrow walkway between the bed and
the wall, and there is no place to sit but on the bed.  It's a good thing the
bed looks so comfortable, because that is probably where you are going to be
spending ALL your time in this room.

Compared with the rest of this hotel, this room is positively luxurious. 
Which is to say that in the middle class district of this city it would be
thought of as a normal room.  The windows are clean and let in fresh light
and air while the view overlooking the harbor is, if not breathtaking, at
least pretty.  The bed looks very comfortable, and this room boasts an
honest-to-goodness bed stand and even a chair.  All in all, a room well worth
the extra cost paid at the front desk.

Elran's instruments of death~
~
At first glance it becomes obvious that this is a shop of ill repute. 
Lining the wall behind the counter is a large display case with a dizzying
array of weapons and pain-inducing devices.  The counter itself looks more
like the guard cage in a prison than anything which might be expected in a
shop, with thick iron bars seperating it from the room outside.  Obviously,
the proprietor of this shop has too much experience with weaponry not to
take precautions against it.

A Smoking Ruin~
~
This building looks like it used to be an apartment complex, but right
now it's pretty uninhabitable, having been completely gutted by a fire of
some sort.  There doesn't look to be anything of interest here, except
perhaps for a pile of charred rubbish in the middle of the floor.  You could
probably move it, but chances are there isn't anything under it anyway.

Jortagna's assorted armor~
~
This shop has an almost eerie feel to it.  Empty suits of plate stand
guard along one wall.  Limp tunics and leggings of mail hang on hooks like
macabre corpses.  And helmets of all sizes and shapes sit on shelves like
empty skulls.  Doing nothing to detract from this aura is the shopkeeper
himself.  A large, quiet man, he is clad in a suit of red scale-mail which
so completely covers him he almost seems an animated suit of armor himself.

An Abandoned Warehouse~
~
The musty odor of an unused building permeates this decrepit-looking old
warehouse.  The otherwise bare room is piled high with boxes, which probably
only contain useless junk.  The walls and floors are completely bare, and
made of solid grey stone.  It seems as if the place has not been used in
years, but looking at the ground you notice footprints in the heavy layer of
dust, and they seem recent...

A Hidden Shop..~
~
This small, nondescript room is unremarkable..  But that seems to be the
whole point.  The walls are bare grey stone, and the floor the same,
although it has been cleaned recently.  The only furnishings in the room are
the proprietor's counter, made out of polished wood, and a small Makou gas
lamp hanging from the ceiling, giving off a blindingly bright white light. 
Behind the counter you notice a partially concealed entrance to another
room.  Perhaps where the shopkeeper keeps his wares, whatever those might
be..

The Basement~
~
This room seems much older than the apartment complex which used to exist
above it.  Seemingly untouched by the fire, the walls and floor are smooth
marble, covered with a thick layer of dust.  There is a large black marble
altar at the far end of the room.

the richness with which it is decorated.  The solid gold doors on either end

of powerful magic.  Guarding the northward door into the palace proper is a
single statue of- could it be?  {7Mithril!  {0 Gigantic pillars of rare
black marble line the velvet carpeted walkway, and tapestries spun of gold,
silver, and even platinum thread line the towering walls.  Up above, the
dome of the ceiling is intricately painted in a scene of the gods bringing
light to the world.  At the apex of the painting, where the hands of all the
gods meet, there is a single magical ball of light casting its brilliant
illumination upon the entire hall.

Outside Torregiano Reactor #3~
~
You stand outside one of the four Torregiano Makou Reactors.  Above you,
a large tower of metal stands, creating the makou gas that powers the city. 
A strange, deep green glow hovers above the reactor.  The side of the
reactor is painted with a large, unknown symbol.  Under the symbol its
number stands in large letters.  The sound of machinery echos from within
the walls.  A large iron gate stands here, keeping you away.

Outside Torregiano Reactor #1~
~
You stand outside one of the four Torregiano Makou Reactors.  Above you,
a large tower of metal stands, creating the makou gas that powers the city. 
A strange, deep green glow hovers above the reactor.  The side of the
reactor is painted with a large, unknown symbol.  Under the symbol its
number stands in large letters.  The sound of machinery echos from within
the walls.  A large iron gate stands here, keeping you away.

You stand before the Throne of Nightmares.  All around it, candles

throne, looking at you with red eyes.  The throne stands in darkness,
made from a motionless matter, that almost looks like a dream world. 
Draped behind the throne, a 20 foot TriPower Flags hangs vertical,
its war battled status shown brightly from the window behind it.

{x  Welcome to the Airship Engine Shop, there are THREE different types
of engines, which two types come in several sizes.  The size of the
engine does count to the speed of your airship, most are unaware of
this but the lesser power engine on the larger ships such as the battle
cruisers will cause them to be slow.  V4 is the smallest engine, with
V10 being the largest available at this shop.  The third engine type
is called the Munchausen Sub-Ether Engine, which in fact is not a real
engine, but a device built of Materia that allows your airship to
teleport short distances, using the BEACON system.  Type LIST to see
a list of engines.  Type BUY (Number Code) to purchase which engine
you want.  An airship only needs one engine to move, but it will be
extremly slow due to its underpowered engine.

  Welcome to the Airship Weapon Shop, there are five different cannons
available at this shop, and each airship can hold a different amount
of cannons.  The size (mm) of the cannon determines how much damage
it will cause to other airships.  Cannon Balls are available in the
Port Shop located on the 2nd floor.

Port Torregiano Ammo Shop~

Suprisingly this store is very clean and very well kept.  Unlike
some other parts of the hangar, it displays different types of cannon
balls and other ammo for airships.  A small guy sits behind a counter
in the center of the room.  Glass cases stand on the outer walls.  A
door to the south leaders into the Engine Parts Shop, and the Airship
Repair Shop is north.

A small man sits behind a counter, in this overly stuffed room.  A
single counter stands in front of you, and behind it stands row after
row of shelves with dusy boxes.  The room is somewhat dimly lit, and
the heavy smell of grease and buring ores hung over the room.  A
single waiting chair sits next to the bullentin board with the latest
Nudy Calandar.  A doorway to the north leads to another shop, and a
doorway to the east leads to the Weapon Forging Room.

ranging from "The Cookbook of the Nine Hells" to "Inside Secrets of a
Deva", Walden's is sure to have a book for even the most finicky

Rows of souvenir shot glasses line the walls inside locked cases. 
Avoided by the locals, this shop caters mostly to tourists and
travellers that wander in off Torregiano's Main Street.  Despite the

The backroom of the billards is used for parties and concerts.  You
walk into the room, which is made of black cinder blocks.  The lights
above are dim, and only give enough light to navigate through the

stands to the east of the stage.  The backroom continues south into a
group of couches and chairs, and then to the other side of the room.

entire length of the building.  The black cinder block walls and dim
lighting makes it somewhat hard to see.  The air is filled with smoke,
and many different people.  A large plywood room has been built to the
south, along with a makeshift bar used for parties.  To the north you

{x  This vast hanger on the ground floor of Port Torregiano is home to where
{xsomeone would go to purchase an airship.  The hanger itself is filled with
{xbasic models of airships, and sale persons wandering around trying to make
{xa commission off possible buyers.
{x
{x  In this section of Airship Purchasing you will buy the 'Hull' of the
{xairship, which is the basic structure that defines how many rooms, engines
{xand cannons an airship can have.  In addition to buying a 'Hull' you will
{xalso need to buy at -least- 2 Engines, sold in the next room.
{x
{x- Type LIST to see a list of all available airships for sale.
{x
{x  For more details about each design, please see the room located below
{xthis one.  When buying an airship, please keep the following in mind...
{x
{x- You do not need to include THE in the name, such as THE STAR, the mud
{x  automatically inserts this in most airship messages.
{x
{x- Do NOT use apostrophes ' ' within the name of the airship.  This can
{x  have a negative effect on certain commands.  Use a backwords apostrophe
{x  which is located on your TILDA key (usually to the left of Number 1).
{x
{x- The use of non-letter/number characters !@#$%^&*()-=[] is now disallowed.
{x
{x- When you purchase your airship, you will be naming it.  Make sure you
{x  type in the correct command, which is as follows
{x
{x- You do not need to use the {{x color reset character when using color,
{x  this is automatically inserted into the name by the mud.
{x
{x  BUY (Number of the ship in the list) NAME OF YOUR SHIP
{x  Example:  Buy 4 Titanica
{x  The Highwind 'Titanica' is parked here.
{x
{x  The room located to the west houses the Engine Shop, you will only need
{xyour airship keys when making these purchases.  The keys will appear in
{xyour inventory after purchase.  The Weapon/Cannon Shop is located two
{xwests from here, but is not needed for flight.

Before you is the inside of the Port Torregiano Repair Shop.  The
floor is covered in airship parts, from complete engines to hull
plates.  The floor also looks to be covered in grease and oil.  Large
chains hang from the ceiling used to hoist up the parts of the
airship.  There is no windows or doors in this area, and has the feel
of being underground.  The large opening above with daylight shining
in is good proof of this, along with a massive wooden platform in the
center of the room to lift airships up to the next level.
{x
{x  TIP: Your Airship is currently being "AUTO" Repaired, which means
the hitpoints will be restored after 4 ticks.  Once your airship is
repaired, it will be dropped off in the Port Torregiano Airship Repair
Shop Pick-Up Lot, located above.  To save money you can use the REPAIR
command in the Repair Shop located UP and EAST from this location.

parking field.  The room is open with a high ceiling, big enough
for a couple of airships to be parked inside.  A large sign hangs
down from the ceiling reading AIRSHIP PICK-UP DOCK.  If you have
had your airship "towed" with the Automatic Repair option, then
your airship will appear here.  It will take several ticks for the
repair crew to complete its repair, in which time the ship will be
dropped off and ready to fly once again.  There are doorways to the
east and west.

A fenced in area here houses many airships, parked in a row and
chained to the ground.  Some airships look like they have been here
for many years, a fine layer of dust from the outside collecting on
their hulls.  To the north, you see a turn-style gate leaving the
impound lot to the Port Torregiano Tarmack.  To the west is the
Impound Lot Office.

The smell of hot pasta and pizza floats around in the air, as
waiters and waitresses wander around the fancy and decked out dining
hall.  A low light only gives a glance at the pricey high cut cloths
and solid gold jewerly.  The waiters and waitresses wander back and
forth up a flight of stairs in one corner, which the sounds of the
kitchen echo from the top.  The walls and carpets are red, as large
red draperies hang from all ends of the room.  Tables and booths line
the floor, each pointing themselves out with a small gaslight.  In one
corner a small stage with a lone gas light burns, as a couple
musicians beat out a song.  Welcome to Tony's Pizza Parlor of
Torregiano.

A vampire constantly stands outside to the south leading into a
club known as The Lifeforce.  The club is exclusive to vampires only,
which sometimes causes problems to out of towners who do not know any
better.  Its also known if you slip the bouncers some cash, vampire or
not they will allow you to enter their club.  Its also known as the
party area of the city, always filled at night with the younger crowds
of people coming out, to hand in the clubs.  North of the street is
the Torregiano Battle Gardens, home to the battle arenas of the city. 
To the south stands Kalilyn Park, the only major area of nature found
inside the city, besides people's front lawns in the neighborhoods.

A small building stands off the side of Main Street in sub-sectors
1 and 2.  Inside is basically a bar, with many horses sitting to the
far east in stables.  A young man walks around with a broom sweeping
up the hay that has accumulated on the main floor.  A small desk
stands to one side, also covered in hair.  The young man looks up as
you enter his shop.

A massive tunnel runs off north into the distance, big enough for
several airships to run side by side.  Dim gas lights bring light all
the way down, but mostly the tunnel disappears into the darkness.  To
the west is the development area of the Airship Testing Facility.  To
the east is the Control Room and offices of the ATF.

The Gates Of [T rr gi n ]~
~
You stand infront of large iron gates, they stand 25 feet tall,
made from large boards, wrapped in iron hinges.  A few makou gas
touches burn on either side of the door, giving some light.  A ladder
here leads upwards on to the top of the wall.  The iron sign of the
gates stands inbedded on the stone face, on the outside of the wall. 
The letters look knew, but not all there.

Large glass windows look out into the tunnel, and special machines
are lined up to rate and test the airships that run the course.  There
are several tables setup in the room covered in manufactor designs and
blueprints.  Other tables have large notebooks and test results laying
on the them.  The walls are covered with all kinds of charts and other
stuff.

A lonely dirt road travels through the open expanse of the Istar
plains.  The surrounding countryside is quite flat and covered in
tall golden wild wheat.  When the wind blows, the plains ripple as
is they were liquid.  The road continues west and east.

Before you stands a pair of large, iron and wood gates.  The gates
look big enough to fit a large dragon through it.  The gates stand,
holding the contents of Torregiano within.  Above it stands one of the
many Makou Reactors of the city.  Two guards, dressed in military
uniforms of the Tripower stand on either side of the gate, staring at
the people approaching the gates.  You look at the iron and rock wall
that outstretches to either side of you, curving inwards, giving the
city a circular wall.  You notice right before the gates a large metal
strip that is splitting the ground between the city and the city.  The
strip seems to follow the wall, about a foot outwards all the way to
either side of you.  Behind you is the highway that brought you here,
and the northern plains of the TriPower country.

Under the Makou Reactor directly above the southern gates of
Torregiano is the security check point.  A large iron gate spreads
across the opening, and five smaller turn-style gates stand. 
Torregiano Guards watch over the people entering and leaving the city,
for illegal items that are against City Law.  To the south is the iron
gates of Torregiano, and to the north is Torregiano Square, and Main

Torregiano Square, the centerpoint of the lower sectors of
Torregiano.  The square stands outside the southern gates, and has a
large clock in the center.  To the west you see Zozo Avenue, aka
Sector 1.  Down that street you see middle class homes, and a nice
neighborhood.  To the east you see Camelot Ave aka Sector 2.  The
street stretches into another middle class neighborhood.  To the
north, Main Street stretchs all the way to the northern end of
Torregiano.  The TriPower Tower Complex rises above the city skyline. 
Dwarfing the city is the Cannon Support Track, three massive rings
held up by iron towers, that hold the 5000mm cannon known as Stalin's
Organ.

the Great Realms move back and forth on the tarmack, doing their daily
jobs.  Port Torregiano is one of the largest airships ports in the

Welcome to Port Torregiano, the leader Airship Port in the Great
Realms.  Before you stands a massive building which looks down into
the actual port area, all shown by large glass windows looking out
over the port.  Several arms stick out from the port building, in
which airships are docked to.  Passangers, Tourist and Trade Workers
march up and down the lobby, doing their daily business.  Small Signs
hang from the ceiling pointing out certain "locations" within the
port.

[Lession 1: The Airship]
An airship is a big sailing type vessel that is built for flying
in the air.  They resemble an old scooner type boat with a blimp
holding them up.  Graphical pictures are available on the web
site (Help WWW).  On the mud, it is a moveable object which you
enter like a portal, inside will be a helm, and a bunch of rooms
that you can use for your own purpose.  They have cannons which
can be used to attack each other, they can teleport to locations,
they have engines, they use fuel, they take damage, and later on
they will go to airship-accessable areas and be used to make
platinum by transporting cargo.  As an owner you will need to
concern yourself about parts of your ship, and other things.

[Lession 2: The Systems]
{x
Your airship is made up of several systems.
HULLS * ENGINES * WEAPONS * FUEL * REPAIR
{x
HULLS:  The hull of your airship is basically how much hitpoints
your airship has.  Hitpoints are what determines the working
condition of your ship, when it becomes 0, your airship is
disabled.
{x
ENGINES:  Engines determine the speed of your airship, and come
in several sizes.  The more engines you have, the faster your
airship will go.  The bigger the engine, the faster your airship
will go.  Engines can be purchased in the Engine Construction Shop.
{x
WEAPONS:  Weapons are your defence against another airship.  There
are no "NPK" airships that are immune to attack, all airships are
open to attack.  The bigger the weapon, the more damage you will
do.  Weapons require ammo.  Weapons can be purchased in the Weapon
Construction Shop.  Ammo can be purchased at Ammo Shops.
{x
FUEL:  Needed to move your airship.  Fuel is purchased at fueling
stations like a shop.  If you do not have fuel, your airship will
not run.  Fuel usage is determined by 1 gallon per engine every
airship tick, which is 4 to 6 minutes.
{x
REPAIRS:  At times after battle when your airship is disabled or
damaged, you may need to repair the airship.  Your airship will
be towed and repaired back to full hitpoints.

[Lesson 3: Your Airship Hull & Design]
{x
The term hull is used for two different systems.  At the hull
construction shop, you will find different models and designs
that you will purchase to make your airship.  Each model has
its own specifications, and can be found at HELP AIRSHIP-MANU.
{x
The second term is Hull Materia, which is what the outside of
your airship is constructive of, and how much hitpoints your
airship will have.  When you first purchase your airship, it
will have a WOODEN HULL, which is only 10,000 hitpoints.  There
are six other different types, and a max of 40,000 hitpoints.
You can "Upgrade" your hull using the "HULL" command.  Type
HULL HELP to learn how to use the command.

Before Buying An Airship...
{x
This is a little warning to anyone who is looking to purchase
an airship.  An airship is like a hobby, it requires that you
be around, and will cost you money.  It is a complicated system
which might take time to fully learn, and something new to muds.
Airships are expensive, and you cannot just buy an airship and
say {C "I don't like these" and make it disappear.  Immortals do
not refund airships.  With this warning, continue the school.
{x
Airship shops are not ran by mobs.  You just type LIST and BUY
to run the shops, within the empty rooms.

What You Will Need To Buy...
{x
The first thing you will need to buy is a HULL DESIGN.  This
is the biggest part of your ship, which determines just about
all aspects of an airship.  First you need to figure out which
airship you want to buy, and what is within your price range.
To see information about airships, see Help Airship-Manufactor.
{x
When you have figured it out, type BUY (#) (Name Of Airship).
You will name your airship at this time.  After you have the
hull, next you will get the engines.
{x
Engines will determine how fast you go, the bigger the engine,
the faster you will go.  You will find a list of engines in the
Engine Construction Shop.  Each airship has its own max number
of engines.  You do not need to purchase all of these engines,
but it will harm your speed horribly.

Arming Your Airship
{x
All airships in the sky are vulnerable to attack.  You do not
need to purchase weapons, but you will have no defence against
attack.  You will find weapons sold in an airship weapons
construction shop.  Each airship has its own max number of
weapons it can hold.  You do not need to purchase all of the
cannons.
{x
Ammo for the weapons can be found at Ammo Shops, usually located
near a weapon shop.

Welcome to the AIRSHIP BATTLE SCHOOL, which will help you
understand how to fire your weapons, and to hunt other airships.  This
school is part of a series of schools to help you work with your
airship.  The school is setup with rooms explaning information about
the airships, like help files.  After reading each room, go DOWN, to
continue the lesson.  And the end you will return to this room.

The Airship Battle School~
~
[Lesson One: Aiming Your Weapons]
{x
To begin, you should already have purchased your weapons.  You
will need ammo to fire your cannons, which can be purchased at
an ammo shop.  There is currently no command to check how many
shots you have in your cannon.  Your airship can aim only at
other airships and in directions, and can only cause damage to
other airships.
{x
TO AIM AT AIRSHIPS
{x
To aim your weapons at other airships, you type the following,
{x
Aim (Cannon Name) (Airship Name).
{x
When you type look, the cannon will show it aiming at the airship.
{x
TO AIM IN A DIRECTION
{x
To aim your weapon in a direction, you type the following,
{x
Aim (Direction) (Airship Name).
{x
You can hit airships aiming in a direction, and your range is
the area borders (shots will not cross into different areas).
But it is a bigger chance of missing than direct aim.

[Lesson Two: Firing Your Weapons]
{x
To fire your weapons, you type FIRE (Weapon Name).  The weapon
will fire, making it unable to fire again, until you either
hit a target, or miss.  After you recieve a message of either
hit or miss, you may fire again.
{x
If you purchase multiple cannons of the same name, you will use
a small alias system built into the mud.  Here is an example of
aiming multiple weapons.
{x
EXAMPLE:  Aim CANNON Target, Aim 2.CANNON Target, Aim 3.CANNON Target

[Lesson Three: The Ping Command]
{x
The ping command is your best friend in battle, and in hunting
down other airships.  You type "PING (Direction)" and it will
tell you any airship or mob in that direction, up to 25 rooms.
It will also tell you how many "clicks" it is from you, which
means room.  If you type "Drive (Direction)" that many clicks,
you will reach its location.

{x  A massive door opens up to the north leading out to the airship
parking field.  The room is open with a high ceiling, big enough
for a couple of airships to be parked inside.  Either side of the
room the walls are built as iron shelves, holding large wooden
crates.  Several workers slide around on ladders connected to the
shelves, latching hooks onto the crate from chains in the ceiling.
A large desk sits in the back of the room jam packed with papers.
Painted on the front of the desk reads COURIER CARGO MANAGER.

Massive windows stretch out away from the building overlooking the
working airship tarmack below.  The windows are rounded out, as so the
room that is sticking out.  Inside the room is a few benches and live
trees.  Outside the airship tarmack stands, with the long term storage
towers in the distance.  Directly north is the fuel pumps of the port.
To the east the Port Building stretches east, and then turns north
following the outter parts of the tarmack.  The Port Building also

The hustle and bustle of downtown is all around as North Main
Street runs along the center of the city.  To the north the large
Leigionaire Harbor Bridge stands, going over top the Harbor below to
the Islane of Accomaxx, once home to the Legion Base.  To the south in
the center of the city stands the Tripower Complex Tower, home to the
Tripower itself.  To the west stands a small two story building.  The
front window of the shop reads The Hobby Shop, displaying some board
games and a bag of dice.

Three streets intersect here in the eastern end of the city.  To
the west runs Hilp Avenue, famous for its bars, pubs, eateries, and
most of all the Torregiano Battle Gardens, the city's famous battle
arena for people and airships.  To the north runs Cannon Boulevard,
filled with middle class row housing and apartment buildings, leading
north to Westbridge Avenue and the Harbor.  To the south runs Cannon
Avenue, home to the rich row housing and apartments of the city,
running along the southeast side of Kalilyn Park, ending with Camelot
Avenue which runs along the southern side of the city.  To the east a
large building stands which looks to be a club.  A large iron shaped
bong sits on top of the building, producing fake bong.  A green sign

A massive marble swimming pool stretches out here, steaming hot
from heated water piped in from a source unknown.  The pool stretches
out, slowly deepening towards one end.  The water is a light blue, the
same color as the Sea of Istar.  Around the pool a tiled floor wraps
around, warm to the touch.  A long wooden bench stretches against the
wall, and a diving board hangs overhead.  A massive skylight looks out
into the sky above, and clear fogged bricks look out into the Tripower
Plaza.

The roadway has a strange sound when feet, wheels or anything
touches it.  Unlike cobble stone streets and other roadways, the
surface seems to be made of crushed white colored stone.  Its soft on
the feet, but at times needs to be smoothed out and graded, which can
be costly for the comfort.  Here and there some plants have managed to
grow in the stones, and yet again people must walk and pull the weeds
out, because sooner or later nature would reclaim this path.  The
white road can be seen for a long distance, travelling in a straight
line within the grassy plains of the Istar Sea.  Eastwards the city of
Torregiano can be seen, its massive walls julting upwards far above
the grass, or the massive cannon which sits above the city.  Westwards
the road heads towards the Vectorian Empire, and Makou City.

Its almost like an endless road, there is very little in the
surrounding area to break it up from looking like the rest of the
road.  The Istar Plains, also sometimes called the Torregiano Plains
is mainly made up of grass fields.  Much of it is left to grow wild,
with an occational farm cutting into the wilderness with well groomed
crop fields.  Southwards the Reaper Scythe Mountains stretch upwards
and block the southern view.  These mountains merge into the 'Central
Bowl' mountains that makes up the center of the Cruoris continent, and
can be seen westwards.  These mountains are much taller than the
Reaper Scythe, many of the peaks stretching far into the atmosphere,
and always snow covered.  The South Istar Roadway continues east
towards Torregiano, or west towards Makou City and the road to Vector.

The intersection of Main Street, Shire Avenue and Westbridge Avenue
at the northern end of Torregiano.  This is between Sector 5 to the
east, and Sector 6 to the west.  The northern districts of Torregiano
is more of the industrial zone, a dirty high crime area.  To the west
on Shire Avenue you see a long road leading down an industrial zone. 
Many warehouses and factories line the side of that street, even a few
apartment buildings....  To the east is Westbridge Avenue, a low class
residential area made up of most of the fishermen crowd, from the
port.  South is Main Street running between Sectors 5 and 6, and going
into the rich Sector 9.

The {&G{*ate{&s {Bof {RT{rorregiano{x~
~
Before you stands a pair of large, iron and wood gates.  The gates
look big enough to fit a large dragon through it.  The gates stand,
holding the contents of Torregiano within.  Above it stands one of the
many Makou Reactors of the city.  Two guards, dressed in military
uniforms of the Tripower stand on either side of the gate, staring at
the people approaching the gates.  You look at the iron and rock wall
that outstretches to either side of you, curving inwards, giving the
city a circular wall.  You notice right before the gates a large metal
strip that is splitting the ground between the city and the city.  The
strip seems to follow the wall, about a foot outwards all the way to
either side of you.  Behind you is the highway that brought you here,
and the northern plains of the TriPower country.

Below runs a massive beam of iron, forged by the Dwarven Kingdom,
know for its genious work in the art of metal creation.  The Harbor
Bridge was built mostly from this metal, including the massive tower
in the center.  To the north, the island of Accomaxx, once home of the
Legion, now more a neighborhood of upper class houses and stores.  To
the south stands the massive city of Torregiano, stretching south
almost to the horizon.  On a clear day, you can see the mountains that
divide the city from other cities, like Westbridge.  To the east and
west access ladders run down the tower to the bridge itself.  An
unsteady footing might cause for a nasty spill.

A massive hangar opens up revealing enough room to stuff a small
fleet of airships within.  This is the Tripower Industrial Hangar,
personal hangar of the Tripower Company.  There is nothing too special
about this area though, the floors are made from large stone tiles,
the walls are made from stone blocks.  There are large timber supports
holding up the ceiling.  Makou Lamps hang down by chains to help
illuminate the area.

The Workshop~

A large workshop expands before you here, just big enough for one
large airship to fit in.  Large oak chests line a wall, with a large
oak counter in front of them.  Tools are laid out neatly on the
countertop, and some of the drawers in the chests are open.  A cork
board hangs from the wall, with tons of papers tacked into it.

To the north stands a wooden door with a large window, blocked by a
peice of leather.  The glass on the door reads | Starwind & Hawkins |

A large room opens up with an office full of papers.  Two large
desks stand side by side, with their backs to the windows overlooking
New Thalos Avenue.  A single chair sits in front of each desk, but
does not look like they have been in any use yet.  Shelves line the
opposite walls, compacted with books and papers, somewhat neatly
placed.  The walls contain a few paintings.
